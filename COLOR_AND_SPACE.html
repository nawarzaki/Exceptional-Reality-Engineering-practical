          <h2>COLOR AND SPACE </h2>
        </header>
        <p>The process by which color is chosen and utilized in a design has a profound effect on interior
          space. The designer's decisions can drastically change the spatial understanding of a project
          and also influence how it is navigated.</p>
        <p>When used with knowledge and intent, color can add
          perceived weight to surfaces, alter the basic proportions of a room, and variously be a calming or
          exciting
          factor. As the designer begins to explore and understand the surface effects of
          color, it will become the basis of a rich visual and material palette. </p>
        <br><br>

        <div id="Volumetric_Approaches_to_Color">

          <ul>
            <li>
              <h3>Volumetric Approaches to Color </h3>
              <p>Painting all aspects of a room the same color has the effect of volumizing the space. This method
                of
                using
                color can be particularly effective in making small spaces appear larger or more intimate depending
                on
                the color choices.
              </p>
              <p>Volumetric approaches work best in situations where they can be referenced in sequence, such as an
                enfilade, or series of rooms connected through doors.</p>
            </li> <br> <br>

            <li>
              <h3>Planar Approaches to Color</h3>
              <p>Color can be used to emphasize the planes in a given sequence of
                rooms or the vertical connection of spaces, as in a double-height
                room or loft. Painting a length of wall regardless of interruption can
                lead the eye though the spaces of a design and highlight elements at
                the end of the wall-be it a light fixture, art, or furniture piece. Planar
                color can also make surfaces that are perpendicular to the occupant
                appear closer or further away. </p>
            </li><br> <br>

            <li>
              <h3>Emphasizing Design Elements</h3>
              <p>Emphasizing the small-scale elements of a design-door and window
                trim, reveals at the ceiling, or the connection of materials-can draw
                the viewer's attention to subtle aspects of the design that might be
                missed on initial inspection.
              </p>
              <p>Painting elements such as reveals in
                the ceiling a darker color than adjacent objects can make the objects
                appear to float. Emphasizing the color of a door in a wall can cue the
                viewer to its importance. A red door in a white wall will seem more
                present in the room than a door within a wall of the same color. </p>

              <p>Color can be employed to make certain aspects
                of a design stand out. For instance, elements
                such as trim, moldings, and furniture take on
                more significance when they are colored in stark
                contrast with their surroundings. </p>
            </li> <br> <br>

            <li>
              <h3>Changing the Proportions of a Room</h3>
              <p>Color can change how the proportions of a room are perceived.
                Adding color to a certain datum, altering paint sheen, or darkening
                a room's upper portions are some of the strategies by which the
                designer might play with spatial perception.
              </p>
              <p>Through the careful application of color, spaces can be made to appear smaller or larger, or
                an eccentric volume can be proportionally controlled. Using color in
                geometric and abstract patterns can further enhance a space. </p>

              <p>Adding color to the lower half of a space can provide a demarcation line
                for elements such as furniture and art. </p>
              <p>Adding color to the upper regions of a space can
                reduce the perceived height of a room. </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
