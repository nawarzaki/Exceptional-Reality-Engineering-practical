        <h1>High-Rise Structures</h1>
      </header>

      <ul>
        <p>Building engineers, architects, builders, inspectors, and
          related professions often define a high-rise as a building
          that is at least ten stories or more, or one that rises to
          a height of 100 feet (30 m) or more. Building codes may
          refer to a certain height above the lowest level of fire
          department vehicle access. The Council on Tall Buildings,
          however, defines a high-rise as follows:</p>

        <li>
          <p>A tall building is not defined by its height or number
            of stories. The important criterion is whether or not
            the design is influenced by some aspect of “tallness.”
            It is a building in which “tallness” strongly influences
            planning, design and use. It is a building whose height
            creates different conditions in the design, construction,
            and operation from those that exist in “common”
            buildings of a certain region and period.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>From this definition, we can see that a tall building is not
            just defined by its height alone but by its proportions.</p>
        </li>

        <p>The same basic principles of structural design apply to
          high-rise buildings as for any other type of construction. </p>

        <p>Individual members and the overall structure must be
          designed for adequate strength under gravity and lateral
          loads and there needs to be enough stiffness built into
          the structure to restrict deflections to acceptable levels. </p>

        <p>Nevertheless, the structural systems of high-rise buildings
          tend to be dominated by the need to resist lateral forces.
          The provisions for lateral force strength, drift control,
          dynamic behavior, and resistance to overturning
          overshadow the provisions for gravity load-carrying ability.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/High Rise Structures/HIGH RISE STRUCTURES 1.jpg"
            alt="HIGH RISE STRUCTURES" style="height: 24%; width: 24%;">
          <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/High Rise Structures/HIGH RISE STRUCTURES 2.jpg"
            alt="HIGH RISE STRUCTURES" style="height: 24%; width: 39%;">
        </figure> <br><br>

        <li>
          <p>The effects of lateral forces on a structure increase
            significantly with its height and slenderness.</p>
        </li>

      </ul>

      <p>Lateral deflection or drift can become very large as the
        height of a building increases. Excessive deflections can
        cause elevators to become misaligned and occupants to
        have adverse reactions to the movement. The two primary
        causes of lateral deflections and vibrations are wind load
        and seismic forces. Another factor that cannot be ignored
        is the temperature differential, between the inside and
        outside, and between the sunny and shady sides of a
        building.</p>

      <p>As tall structures are displaced from a true and plumb
        position, the weight of the structure, displaced from
        the neutral center position, contributes an additional
        overturning moment. The magnitude of this additional
        moment is commonly in the order of 10% of the moment
        creating the original displacement. This potentially serious
        phenomenon is known as the P-delta effect.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/High Rise Structures/HIGH RISE STRUCTURES 3.png" alt="HIGH RISE STRUCTURES"
          style="height: 24%; width: 39%;">

        </figcaption>
      </figure> <br><br>

      <p>he construction materials for high-rise buildings are
        varied and are used most often in combination: structural
        steel, reinforced concrete, and prestressed concrete.</p>

      <p>The quantity of structural material required per square foot
        of floor of a high-rise building exceeds the requirements
        for low- and medium-rise buildings. The vertical load
        carrying elements—columns, walls, and shafts—need
        strengthening over the entire height of the building and the
        quantity of materials required for lateral load resistance is
        even more significant.</p>

      <p>Since the floor systems in high-rise buildings are typically
        repetitive in nature, the structural depth of the floor system
        can have a major impact on the building design. Saving a
        few inches per floor level can add up to an accumulation
        of many feet in the building. This will affect the cost
        of elevators, wall cladding, and other subsystems. Any
        weight added to the floor systems will also increase the
        size and cost of the foundation system.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/High Rise Structures/HIGH RISE STRUCTURES 4.png" alt="HIGH RISE STRUCTURES"
          style="height: 24%; width: 36%;">
        <figcaption>
          <p><b>HIGH RISE STRUCTURES</b></p>
        </figcaption>
      </figure> <br><br>

      <p>To these supplemental costs must be added the increase
        in cost of the building services, primarily the vertical
        transportation system. The cost of the net usable floor
        area is further increased by the space required for the
        vertical transportation system, which increases with the
        height of the building. This increase in size of the vertical
        transportation core, however, can be used as an important
        part of the vertical and lateral load-carrying strategy.</p>
