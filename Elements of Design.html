            <h2>The Elements of Design</h2>
          </header>
          <p>The elements of design—space, shape or form, mass, line, texture, pattern, light, and color—are used by
            every designer in every discipline. These elements were not invented but discovered and skillfully
            incorporated and balanced by artisans and designers over the course of history. Because of the basic and
            crucial nature of the elements of design, they are discussed in nearly every fi ne-art textbook and wherever
            the education or evaluation of a designed work takes place.</p>
        </div> <br><br>

        <div id="The_Elements_of_Design">

          <ul>
            <li>
              <h3>Space</h3>
              <p>Space exists as a diffuse, endless entity until it is defined. </p>
              <p>The definition of space occurs with building construction, resulting in exterior and interior spatial
                allotments.
                The divisions and restrictions of space form the foundation of architectural planning. Interior
                designers often create unequal space allotments within buildings not only for aesthetic reasons but to
                answer human needs, as well. Treating spaces of different sizes addresses two basic human needs. First
                is the need to be protected, enclosed, and comforted. Small spaces give a sense of security from
                intruders and from the buffeting of the outside world. </p>

              <h3>Small spaces</h3>
              <p>Small spaces establish territory; they give a sense of pride and of ownership, and they offer
                opportunity to personalize our own space. Conversely, small spaces can be restricting or confining and
                can spawn restless-ness and frustration. Small spaces that are inadequate for functions that are
                performed there may visually be expanded through the use of light colors, wall-to-wall neutral floor
                coverings, small-scale furnishings, mirrors, and smoothly textured surfaces or textures with little
                pattern. Generous light from more than one source can also give the impression of more space than
                actually exists.</p>

              <h3>Large space</h3>
              <p>Large space fills a second basic human need as an outgrowth of the confinement of small space. This is
                the need to be free, to mentally soar into a space devoid of restrictions, to be stimulated by the
                immensity of space as compared to the insignificance of human scale. The lack of restriction, however,
                can create feelings of insecurity and inadequacy and a desire to return to the safe, secure quarters of
                small spaces. Large interior spaces can be difficult to handle; often there is a need to make the space
                seem smaller than it is. Effective ways of creating more intimacy in large spaces include using medium-
                to large-scale patterns and dark or vivid colors that visually advance, furniture that is heavy or solid
                looking, area rugs (particularly patterned or colored ones that visually break the floor space),
                large-scale artwork, and multiple furniture groupings.
              </p>

              <figure>
                <img src="images/built in bench.png" alt="built_in_bench" style="height:600px ; width:700px">
                <figcaption>This small room-sized loft is ﬁlled with interesting shapes and forms in the built-in bench,
                  cushions, and pillows, the oval window, dado paneling, and doors. Other elements of design are well
                  selected: the rich pattern and colors of the Oriental rug, the red pillows, and neutralized green wood
                  trim. Upper walls and ceiling are lighter, visually expanding this small space.</figcaption>
              </figure> <br><br>

              <p>Many well-planned interiors incorporate both small and large spaces. We see this in homes where a
                living area has a high ceiling, where a family room or great room has generous square footage, or where
                several rooms open onto a solarium, deck, or covered patio.</p>

              <p> In contract interiors, such as business and professional centers, shopping malls, or hotels, the
                small, enclosed quarters are offices, boutiques, shops, or hotel rooms, and these are often grouped
                around a courtyard, atrium, ball-room, or multistoried open lobby area.</p>

              <p>To emerge from small spaces into large or tall spaces can be exhilarating and satisfying, yet the
                return to the small areas can bring about a needed sense of personal belonging, security, and safety.
              </p>

              <p>Interior designers create interesting areas of positive and negative space. Positive space is space
                filled with color, texture, form, or mass. This could be walls, furnishings, art, area rugs, or even
                graphics or scenes painted on walls. Negative space is the empty space surrounding the positive
                space—the windows between walls, the floor around the area rug, the wall around and between works of
                art, the space between furniture pieces, or even the cubic footage. In a successful interior, the
                positive and negative spaces should be balanced in terms of both amount and placement. Some areas may be
                primarily positive space, others primarily negative, and still others equally distributed between the
                two. For example, the proportion of negative (empty wall) space between works of art hanging on walls
                may remain relatively even, or it may be unevenly distributed.</p>

            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>Shape or Form</h3>
              <p>While we sometimes think of shape as only a two-dimensional outline, form (which is an extension of
                shape) is the three-dimensional configuration of the objects within the interior. For example, furniture
                seen in silhouette has shape that can be perceived, and as we move around the furniture, the silhouette
                changes and we begin to comprehend the three-dimensional quality of the form.</p>

              <p>For example, a rectangular table can be an appreciated form and shape that is simple and pleasing, yet
                if the entire room were filled with similar shapes and forms, the room would become boring and
                repetitious. There needs to be a balance of form—a curved chair to soften the straight lines of the
                table form. The forms that are placed next to each other will have considerable effect on each other.
                Sometimes the juxtaposition of unlikely elements, such as the tandem placements of a vintage piece of
                furniture with a thoroughly modern piece, can create a delightful and charming surprise.</p>

              <p>On the other hand, certain forms destroy the integrity of each other and prove disastrous to both
                objects. This might be the placement of a delicate and lacy plant next to the abstract lines of a modern
                painting where the incongruity is jolting and disturbing. Perhaps a sculptural, abstract plant form,
                such as a cactus, would be better suited to the shapes in the painting.</p>

              <p>The key to selecting forms is to balance them against the proportion and scale of the architecture for
                the desired psychological effect or feeling and to select each form to complement other nearby forms.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>Mass</h3>
              <p>Is the solidity, matter, or density that is defined by shape or form. In furniture, mass is actual
                density when the material is filled in, such as a solid block of wood.</p>
              <p>Massing means grouping together components such as accessories, furniture, or blocks of architecture to
                create a unified “group mass.” Massing will give a weighted, more solid, or imposing appearance. For
                example, several framed art pieces on a wall will create an important, heavier-looking arrangement than
                just one or two isolated small pieces. On the coffee table, a book, pot-ted plant, and objects of art
                grouped into an interesting composition will draw more attention than would the book alone. Two sofas
                placed in an L shape or parallel to each other will look more impressive than a single sofa.

              <figure>
                <img src="images/massing Grouped.png" alt="massing" style="height:600px ; width:700px">
                <figcaption>Grouped photos are examples of massing to create a uniﬁed group mass for a weighted and more
                  important appearance. On the left wall, photos and accessories are massed, as are the pillows on the
                  bed.</figcaption>
              </figure> <br><br>

              <p><b>Architects use massing as a tool to create emphasis or to draw attention. For example, when an
                  exterior is analyzed, it is often clear that the architect has manipulated window openings, wings, or
                  shapes of the roof in such a way as to create areas of emphasis and balance via massing.</b></p>

              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>Line</h3>
              <p>Line is the connection of two or more points. The eye also perceives line when two planes meet and when
                shape is seen in silhouette as an outline. Lines may be straight (horizontal or vertical), angular
                (diagonal or zigzag), and curved (circular, flowing, or tightly curved). Lines are used by interior
                designers to create effects such as increased height, width, or the impression of movement. The
                psychology of line is important to creating ambience or a particular mood in interior design. </p>

                <h2>Straight Lines</h2>
              </header>

              <h3>Horizontal Lines:</h3>

              <p>Weighty, Secure, Restful, Repose Horizontal lines suggest a solid, harmonious relationship with
                the earth; earth`s gravity has no further pull.
              </p>

              <p>Long horizontal lines can visually expand space, making rooms appear wider or longer. When found in a
                connecting architectural detail such as a molding, horizontal lines provide a smooth transition between
                rooms or areas. </p>

              <p>If they lead to a focal point, they help to emphasize it; when they stop at a window, the eye is guided
                to the exterior view. An interior with too many horizontal lines may become boring and lack interest.
              </p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Horizontal lines.png" alt="Horizontal lines" style="height:560px ; width:720px">
              </figure> <br><br>

              <h3>Vertical Lines:</h3>
              <p>Vertical lines lift the eye upward. They have the ability to lift the mind and the spirit as well. As
                such, vertical lines are a purposeful tool for architects and designers of churches and public buildings
                because they inspire awe and tend to diminish the significance of human scale. </p>

              <p>The use of vertical lines can make an interior seem higher, apparently increasing vertical space.
                Vertical lines are stable because they represent a perpendicular resistance to earth`s gravity. </p>


              <p>They convey a feeling of strength and dignity and are quite appropriate in formal dining rooms,
                entryways, and formal living areas. This formality can bring a stiffness or commanding feeling to the
                interior. Too many vertical lines can cause a feeling of uneasiness, of too much confinement and
                predictability.</p>

              <figure>
                <img src="images/Vertical lines.png" alt="Vertical lines" style="height:600px ; width:600px">

              <header>
                <h2>Angular Lines</h2>
              </header>

              <h3>Diagonal Lines: </h3>

              <p>Action, Movement, Interest, Angular Stability</p>
              <p>Diagonal lines are flexible because their exact direction may vary from shallow to steep angles.
                Diagonal lines generally suggest movement, action, or dynamism, perhaps </p>

              <p>Because diagonal lines are associated with going places: up or down a diagonal staircase or an
                escalator, the taking off or landing of an airplane. </p>

              <p>Interest is usually sustained longer with diagonal lines than with horizontal or vertical lines,
                possibly because the angles appear to defy gravity and the eye and mind are stimulated. Yet diagonal
                lines can also be secure, such as the reinforcing diagonals of an angled roof truss system. Too many
                diagonal lines, particularly on the wall, can be overstimulating and tiresome.</p>

              <br><br>

              <h3>Zigzag Lines:</h3>
              <p>Exciting, Lively, Rhythmic Movement</p>
              <p>Zigzag lines are short diagonal lines that reverse upon themselves and form a regular or irregular
                pattern. </p>
              <p>A zigzag line can be one single line or several in a set. A set of regular zigzag lines is called a
                chevron or herringbone pattern, and irregular zigzag lines are called a flame stitch pattern. Angular
                zigzag lines can add energy and life to an interior. If too many zigzag lines are incorporated, however,
                the effect can be frenzied and agitating.</p>

            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
              <header>
                <h2>Curved Lines</h2>
              </header>

              <h3>Curved or Circular Lines:</h3>
              <p>Soft, Humanizing, Repetitive Tempo, Gracefulness</p>

              <p>Curved or circular lines provide relief and softness to straight and angular lines and balance the
                harshness of too many straight lines. </p>

              <p>Curved lines give a human quality to interiors; they can be easy on the eyes and pleasant to view. A
                series of curved lines, such as in an arcade (a procession of arches), gives a rhythmic cadence to the
                room, suggesting graceful movement.</p>

              <p>In architectural components, round or elliptic segments (sections of circles or ovals) such as archways
                provide graceful dignity to interiors. Generously curved lines are viewed as feminine. An excess of
                curved lines may become too decorative and, consequently, visually disturbing.</p>

              <h3>flowing Lines:</h3>
              <p>Gentle Movement, Growth, Linear Development</p>

              <p>Flowing lines are irregularly curved lines that move gently in a random or spiraling manner. Flowing
                lines may be seen in large, live interior trees, in spiral or curved stair-cases, or in the lines of fi
                ne Oriental rugs. </p>

              <p>Inspiration may be taken from the graceful curved lines of growing and changing plant forms. Because we
                are never certain where the line will end, flowing lines can provide a great deal of interest.</p>

              <h3>Tightly Curved or Busy Lines: </h3>
              <p>Playful Activity, Zest, Lively Visual Stimulation Tightly curved or busy lines are most often seen in
                textiles and in wall and floor coverings as complicated patterns that are lively, busy, or active.
                Tightly curved lines can add frivolity and fun to interiors and can make up a pattern that visually
                closes in space. </p>

              <p>Complicated tightly curved compositions, such as those in vivid floral fabric patterns or in area rugs,
                add life and may be visually stimulating and aesthetically satisfying. As such, busy lines may save
                interiors from becoming dull or boring, yet control over the quality of the design is imperative. Colors
                and contrast that are too bold or feature too much obvious pattern might prove displeasing and detract
                from the harmony of the.</p>

            <h3>Texture</h3>
            <p>Texture is the surface characteristics and appearance inherent in every element and component of interior
              design. As the relative smoothness or roughness of a surface, texture is determined in two ways: </p>
            <ul>

              <li>
                <p>By touching the physical texture and by visually reading the surface, which may appear quite
                  different
                  to the eye than it actually is to the touch.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Some textures that read as rough are painted or printed tiny patterns that give the impression of a
                  texture when it does not actually exist. An example is the painting of surfaces to look like rock,
                  brick, or tile.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Smooth textures generally are associated with more formal, high-style interiors, while rough textures
                  are often thought to be more casual. Textures generally need to be handled in a unified manner, with a
                  compatible feeling to every other texture selected for the interior.</p>

                <p>However, some contrast in texture is vital for relief and for emphasis. If every texture reads as
                  smooth and glassy, for example, the interior would seem cold and unwelcoming. If every texture is
                  rough,
                  the interior may become harsh and irritating. A balance or a variety of textures is necessary within
                  the
                  unified theme or ambience in order to achieve harmony.</p>

          <div id="Pattern">
            <h3>Pattern</h3>
            <p>Pattern is the arrangement of forms or designs to create an orderly whole. Pattern often consists of a
              number of motifs, or single-design units, arranged into a larger de-sign composition. Pattern is seen in
              printed and woven textiles such as upholstery and drapery fabric, floor rugs, and carpeting.</p>

            <h5>Combining Patterns</h5>
            <p>Patterns are frequently combined in interior design. While some combinations are very successful, we
              often sense incompatibility in other combined pattern schemes. To achieve a feeling of rightness, four
              things need to be evaluated:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The placement of emphasis</li>
              <p>The placement of emphasis. Emphasis is giving importance to one pattern over another so that conflict
                is minimized. Emphasis is established by using a greater amount of one pattern or a larger scale of one
                pattern than another.</p>
              <li>The character of the pattern</li>
              <p>The character of the pattern. When two or more patterns are used in the same interior, the characters
                or styles must be compatible. For example, a dignified Georgian damask or brocade fabric will not be
                compatible with a country Victorian printed cotton one. They will have an entirely different look or
                character.</p>
              <li>The color scheme </li>
              <p>The color scheme. Generally, a closely related color scheme will foster harmony. If one pattern
                contains blues and yellows, for example, then other patterns should also contain exact, similar, or
                compatible hues, values, and intensities. If the colors are close but “off,” then the patterns will not
                combine successfully.</p>
              <li>The scale of the patterns to be combined</li>
              <p>The scale of the pattern. Pattern scale or size can be similar if the style and the color are
                compatible. However, when the scale is the same, multiple patterns often seem to conflict. Varying the
                size or scale of the patterns by using, for example, a large pattern, a small pattern, a tiny pattern, a
                finely blended stripe, or a compatible geometric shape, along with appropriate textures, can be a good
                means of achieving success in combining pattern.</p>
            </ul>

            <h5>Pattern Psychology</h5>
            <p>Consider line direction and the psychological effect when combining patterns. Angled and straight
              patterns are difficult to combine unless there are enough of each to have unity in the space. Curvilinear
              patterns combine more successfully with straight or angled patterns. In small spaces, too many pattern
              directions are confusing. </p>
          </div>

          <div id="Light">

            <h4>Light</h4>
            <p>Light in interior design has two sources: natural light and artificial light. Although natural light
              admitted in a large quantity through expanses of glass windows may need some means of screening to prevent
              glare (too much bright light) or heat buildup, natural light is a desirable and an appreciated element of
              design.</p>
            <p> The quality, quantity, and color of light affect the way we see our surroundings and, as such, need
              direction, control, and perhaps supplemental sources of light. When natural light cannot fully meet the
              needs of the interior design, artificial lighting can make up the difference.</p>
            <p> Artificial light generally comprises incandescent light (the common lightbulb with a tungsten element
              that glows to produce heat) and fluorescent light (luminous lamps).</p>
          </div>

          <div id="Color">
            <h4>Color</h4>
            <p>Color, the last element of design, is the most emotional and personal of all the elements. Although
              everyone has individual preferences toward, and prejudices against, certain colors, humans generally
              respond
              similarly to color combinations within each culture. Here the psychology of color is based on the reaction
              of people in regard to color hue, value, and intensity.</p>

            <h5>Hues, or colors </h5>
            <p>Such as reds, oranges, and yellows are stimulating; blues, greens, and violets are calming. Hues as seen
              on
              the standard color wheel can be divided into equal groups where one half of the wheel consists of warm
              colors that are stimulating, friendly, cozy, and inviting, and the other half consists of calming cool
              colors that suggest restraint, dignity, and formality.</p>

            <h5>Color values </h5>
            <p>Are the relative lightness or darkness of the hues. For example, a high-value, light red is a pink; a
              low-value, dark red is a burgundy. Lighter colors seem to recede, making space appear larger and giving a
              more airy look to the interior, whereas darker values do the opposite—close in and give a cave like
              coziness. Distribution of value is sought after in most fi ne interior de-sign, where some values of
              light, medium, and dark hues are carefully placed to achieve the desired effect.</p>

            <h5>Color intensity </h5>

            <p>is the brightness versus the dullness of a hue. Pure colors can be lowered in intensity by adding a
              neighboring or a contrasting color or by adding white, black, gray, or any combination of these. Bright,
              bold, pure colors are exciting and happy. These need careful handling so as not to become overbearing
              through over-use or indiscriminate placement. Dull colors can be dark, medium, or light in value but are
              generally easy to live with because they are undemanding. Often a good balance is found in rooms that
              utilize the law of chromatic distribution: The larger areas are dulled and neutralized, and the smallest
              areas are brightest, with the intensity becoming brighter as the areas become smaller.</p>
