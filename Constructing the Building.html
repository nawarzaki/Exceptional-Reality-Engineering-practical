            <h2>Constructing the Building</h2>
          </header>

          <p>When construction begins, the architect or general contractor will set up a method for making
            everything
            happen at the right time.</p>

          <p>A critical path indicates the time frame, in consecutive and overlapping
            order, of every step in the building and finishing process.
          </p>

          <p> Scheduling means setting up and reconfirming dates
            for the selected subcontractors to arrive on the site and perform their work. </p>

          <p>If one subcontractor fails to meet the
            deadline for completion, it could disrupt the entire schedule. The next subcontractor on the critical
            path
            may notbe available at a slightly later date because of other commitments. </p>

          <p>It is therefore the responsibility of the general contractor, architect, or project manager to
            coordinate
            the schedule by frequently contacting the subcontractors and reconfirming the schedule.
            This responsibility may affect the work of the interior designer at the finish and/or decoration and
            furnishing stage.</p>

          <p>However, the smooth flow of the construction critical path is crucial to the success of the
            finish critical path, and in many cases, they are not separated.
            Large interior design firms that specialize in nonresidential work routinely work out complex and
            extensive
            critical paths that track the flow of jobs to be performed.</p>

          <figure>
            <img src="images/Constructing the Building/Critical Path.png" alt="Critical Path"
              style="height:80% ; width:100%">
            <figcaption>Critical Path</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <br><br>

          <p>The interior designer must understand the aspects of construction in order to communicate effectively
            with
            subcontractors, architects, engineers, and other professionals.
            A mutual respect and understanding between
            designers and these professionals will allow the designer to better discuss structural plans,
            architectural
            details,finish materials, and furnishing instructions. As a result, these aspects will be more
            successfully
            completed.</p>

          <p>The designer has the responsibility of notifying the builder of special materials or finishes that
            could
            interfere with the critical path.</p>

          <p>For example, if the designer and client change the floor-covering selection from carpeting to
            a wood floor, the building must be left empty for a week or longer to accommodate the floor installers
            and
            finishers.
            This could cause serious problems with the critical path if the designer does not notify the builder in
            advance.
            It is the responsibility of the architect or designerand the builder to see that all aspects of the
            design
            areproperly and correctly executed.</p>

          <h3>Structural Building Components
            and Systems</h3>

          <p>Many kinds of structural systems are in use today. A few
            are quite common; some are unusual and rarely seen.
            Building methods vary according to the environment,
            available materials, and local building codes.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>The Foundation</h4>
              <p>After the lot has been surveyed and laid out with chalk lines, and after the hole for new
                construction
                has been excavated (dug), cement contractors set up wooden and metal frames, pour, and finish
                foundation
                footings.
                Footings are the strips of concrete set into the ground several inches to several feet below the
                excavated basement or crawl space area. Footings anchor the foundation walls
                and serve as a base for the weight of the building.</p>

              <p><b> Foundations</b> are the concrete block or poured concrete walls of the basement or sublevel.
                After
                the
                concrete forms are stripped or removed, the walls must cure for a period of time. Cement is a dry
                mixture of lime, silica, alumina, and other minerals used to bring nonadhesive
                materials together into a strong, cohesive unit.</p>

              <p>
                <b>Concrete</b> is the building material made by mixing cement and a mineral aggregate (gravel) with
                sufficient
                water to cause the cement to set into a hard mass.

                Before it sets, concrete is relatively easy to work and may be poured into forms to become a durable
                material used where strength and stability are requirements and where moisture may permeate
                interiors
                (moisture will rot a wooden structure but may not damage concrete).
              </p>

              <p><b>Reinforced concrete</b> has rebar (strong, bendable steel bars) or wire mesh set into
                the wet mixture before it is dried, which gives structural strength and helps prevent cracking.
              </p>

              <p><b>Flatwork</b> refers to cement for basement floors, garage floors, driveways, and
                walkways; it may be reinforced and poured over sand, gravel, wire mesh, or rebar to minimize
                shifting
                and settling that produce cracks.</p>

              <p>Masonry (concrete) block is another type of foundation </p>

              <p><b>Waterproofing</b>
                the foundation is done by spraying or rolling a sealant—
                such as a tar mixture and perhaps a sheet of heavy black
                plastic or tar paper—onto the foundation walls before the
                dirt is backfilled around it. The sealant prevents water
                seepage into the foundation. The foundation walls may
                also be insulated with styrofoam board before the backfill.</p>

              <p><b>Window wells</b> are corrugated rounded steel or cement units that keep dirt away from a
                basement
                window.
                They may be open at the ground level or can be covered over with ironwork, plastic bubbles, or glass
                block.</p>

              <p><b>Backfilling and compacting</b>
                mean that some of the excavated dirt is filled into the area outside the completed
                footings. Compacting, coupled with wetting the excavated area, hastens the settling process so that
                the
                dirt will be prepared for the subgrade or foundation floors.</p>

              <p><b>Plumbing</b> takes place at three stages:

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>Before the foundation floor is poured, the underground plumbing brings water and sewer pipe
                    into
                    the sublevel and heating (natural gas lines where applicable).</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>The rough plumbing (water systems, tubs and showers, and a central vacuum) is installed and
                    connected when the building is framed.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>The finish plumbing is the installation of fixtures, such as sinks and toilets.</p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              </p>

              <p><b>Framing</b>, the next step, is the wood or steel skeleton. This
                is a crucial step in the construction process, because the
                wooden or steel frame that is set onto the foundation
                (called frame or truss construction) supports the entire
                building.
                <br>
              <p>Once the walls are framed, the interior spaces are
                firmly established, and although it is possible to move
                walls after the building is framed, it is costly in terms of
                time, labor, and inconvenience. Framing is finished with
                the addition of plywood, Celotex, paperboard, styrofoam,
                or other exterior panel materials. These add stability to
                the frame, add some insulation, and provide closure.</p>

              </p>

              <p>A new material made of recycled content with significant potential to positively impact the
                environment
                is Insulating Concrete Forms (ICFs). These are blocks
                or panels made of special plastic foams filled with reinforced concrete. They are easily shaped into
                basements,
                walls, landscaping curves, or any shape imaginable, with
                convenient scrap usability. In the framing process, the
                blocks are most frequently used as exterior walls and are
                easily cut for electrical, plumbing, and window placement. They are also strong enough to hold
                concrete
                and serve as the backer for interior and exterior finishes. ICFs are simple to install; walls go up
                quickly.</p>

              <header>
                <h3>Interior Environmental Control Systems</h3>
              </header>
              <p>Interior systems are now installed, which include the
                rough plumbing, rough electrical, and rough heating.
                Rough plumbing is the installation of pipes that will connect water to the taps; drains from sinks,
                tubs, showers,
                and toilets; and vents for pressure balance, allowing the
                pipes to drain. </p>

              <p>Tubs are set at this time so the wall material can be set around them. Rough heating includes
                forced-air ducts and vents run from the clothes dryer
                hookup. Rough electrical is the wiring from the breaker
                box to each area of the interior where electricity will
                be needed for light fixtures, light switches, and electric
                outlets. Wiring is also installed now for intercoms, telephones, computer, fax, built-in stereo, and
                media equipment. </p>

              <p>Insulation is added at this time, in the form of batts,
                rigid panels, or blown (loose) insulation. A superinsulated structure has a deeper skeleton
                framework
                (up to 0.3 metre) filled with insulation and layered with a thick
                vapor barrier plastic. Very tight superinsulation will
                require air-exchange units to bring necessary fresh air
                into the interior. Several materials can be used to deaden
                sound such as sound board, which absorbs noise and is
                used with Sheetrock or plasterboard.</p>

              <p>Windows are set in place, and the exterior veneer and
                finish materials such as brickwork, siding, and stucco
                are added. The roof is finished with tar paper,
                shingles, (shake shingles are made of wood;
                asbestos, or fire proof, shingles are common)
                or other roofing materials such as bartile
                or metal shingles or panels.</p>

              <p>Exterior finishing includes installing any garage doors, finishing the
                soffit (area under the eaves), the fascia (the front of the eaves), and
                rain gutters (channel rainfall as it drains off the roof), plastering the
                foundation, and any exterior painting of trim.</p>

                <h3>Interior Finish Components</h3>
              </header>

              <p>The interior finish materials and components
                include wall, ceiling, and floor finish materials,
                woodwork and cabinetry, countertops, optional
                wall coverings, and optional window coverings.
                The most common wall and ceiling material is
                Sheetrock, made of pulverized gypsum rock
                (also called drywall, gypsum board, plasterboard, or wallboard). </p>

              <p>The Sheetrock is installed by nailing, screwing, or gluing
                horizontal or vertical panels to the wall studs and
                ceiling joists.
                To move walls after the Sheetrock has been hung constitutes major remodeling and
                is very costly. Wallboard panels measure 3.05-by-1.22 metre
                or 2.44-by-1.22 metre and are cut to fit the space. Seams
                are covered with perfatape (3-inch-wide stiff paper tape), attached and smoothed with plaster
                called mud.</p>

              <p>A smooth finish is more costly than
                texturizing, which is spraying or hand-troweling
                textures of plaster and then lightly sanding the
                wall or ceiling to a desired smoothness. Light
                texturizing is called orange peel, and heavy texturizing is sometimes termed brocade texture.</p>


              <p>Other finish wall materials include wallpaper, ceramic or quarry tile, wood, stone, cork, and
                fabric.
                Other ceiling materials include acoustical tile (suspended
                ceilings), wood, fabric, and wall coverings.</p>

              <p>The finish package—built-in shelves and closet systems, baseboard/door/window trim, and railings—is
                installed next, then painted along with the walls and
                ceilings. Any woodwork to be painted is also installed at
                this point. Doors are removed from the prehung frames,
                painted or stained separately, then hinged. If wood trim
                is to be stained, it may be installed after the general
                painting is done.</p>

              <p>Railings are then installed and finished. Cabinets,
                countertops, and any other built-in units (prefinished) are
                installed as are windowsills of wood, marble, or tile, and
                tub and shower surrounds (cultured marble, onyx, or tile).
                Finish flooring is set in bathrooms and laundry areas so
                that the finish plumbing (sinks, toilets) can be installed.
                Finish electric work (lighting fixtures) is done before, after,
                or concurrently with finish flooring and plumbing.</p>

              <p>The wallpaper is installed next. Following that, the
                carpet or other floors that need some protection (such
                as wood) are installed, and hardware (door handles and
                strike plates) is set in place. Appliances are installed, and
                window treatments may now also be installed. The last
                step is the delivery and arrangement of furniture and
                accessories.</p>

                <h3>Plumbing Systems</h3>
              </header>
              <p>Plumbing is a term that indicates pipe installed within
                a building for carrying a volume of air or water. Plumbing typically means the water intake system,
                water-conditioning and/or water-heating system (including components of passive or active solar
                systems
                discussed
                later in this chapter), and water disposal systems—drains
                and sewer lines. The plumbing carried within the framework or threaded through the masonry block is
                termed rough plumbing. </p>

              <p>Copper pipe is generally used for water
                intake, and cast-iron (more costly but quieter) or plastic (PVC—polyvinyl chloride) pipe is used for
                sewer or waste-water disposal.
                Finish plumbing includes hookups to appliances (dishwashers and clothes washers) and installation of
                fixtures (sinks, toilets, urinals).
                Shower units and bathtubs/whirlpools are installed during the framing before the Sheetrock is hung.
              </p>

              <p>Plumbing is also used to facilitate central vacuum systems and may also be used for fresh air
                intake
                for wood-burning stoves and for furnace (heating) and central
                air-conditioning (cooling) units.</p>

              <p>In contract design, space will usually be allotted for a
                plumbing chase (the thick plumbing wall area) that provides access for maintenance.</p>

              <p>While details of plumbing systems are beyond the
                scope of this text, here are a few considerations for both
                new construction and remodeling:</p>
            </li>

                style="height:40% ; width:30% ;">
              <figcaption>Rough plumbing is installed after the wall is framed.
                The black and copper pipes will carry fresh, culinary water to
                sinks, dishwashers, bathtubs, showers, and washing machines.
                The larger white pipe will carry away the waste water.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br><br>

            <figure>
              <img src="images/Constructing the Building/Plumbing back to back.png" alt="Plumbing back to back"
                style="height:40% ; width:40% ;">
              <figcaption>Plumbing is shown installed back-to-back. A kitchen
                sink on one wall uses the same wall to house the plumbing for a
                washer, a sink, and toilet. This is economical and wise planning,
                although there is an advantage to placing a dryer on the outside
                wall. Plumbing may also be stacked, where bathrooms, for example, are located one above the other,
                using
                the same walls for plumbing.</figcaption>
            </figure>

              <header>
                <h3>plumbing systems</h3>
              </header>
              <li>
                <p>Plumbing is installed within ceilings, floors, and walls,
                  and its location is generally permanent. Although
                  some modification is possible, the process of relocating
                  plumbing is difficult, messy, and expensive.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Central plumbing stacked or back-to-back bathrooms/
                  kitchen/laundry is more economical and prevents
                  waste of materials and energy.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>A slope or grade of about 3.00 milimetre per 3.00 metre is recommended for indoor waste plumbing
                  so
                  that gravity
                  will aid draining, although in many cases this is not
                  mandatory. Waste lines need to be direct (no curves or
                  elbows) to main plumbing stacks (drains) or exit lines
                  in order to drain properly. Vents that connect to the
                  roof are also necessary for correct draw and drain.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Water that has a shorter distance to travel from the water heater to the point of use will stay
                  hotter than water that travels a greater distance.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Two water heaters are useful in large homes; multiple
                  water heaters are used routinely in contract interiors.
                  A second water heater may be necessary for a hot tub
                  or spa, for example.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Conservation should be a consideration. Controls on
                  the water heater allow for the adjustment of temperatures. Natural gas may be less costly for
                  water
                  heating
                  than electricity or heating oil, although costs vary according to geographical region and from
                  time to
                  time.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Running pipes through the floor to a designated water
                  heater is an excellent, even form of radiant floor heating, especially under tile.</p>

            <h3>Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning</h3>
          </header>

          <p>Central heating or space heating of the interior is generally handled through a furnace and connecting
            hot water pipes or ductwork or ducts (run through the walls, floors, and ceiling joists).</p>

          <p>With forced-air heating, the furnace heats an element
            that in turn heats air that passes by it and is blown out.
            Cold-air return vents draw air back to the furnace where
            it is reheated for recirculation. Warm air typically enters
            a room at the floor or ceiling level through registers. </p>

          <p>Many types and price ranges of furnaces exist, fueled by
            electricity, natural gas, coal, or oil.
          </p>

          <p> A high-efficiency furnace uses less fuel to heat the interior and
            therefore costs less to run, although these units have a higher initial purchase price. Furnaces may
            also
            be fitted with humidifying devices (humidifiers) that add moisture to the heated
            air. (Any method of heating will draw moisture out of the
            air, which is harmful to health, plants, and furnishings.)</p>

          <p>Radiant heat is produced by using a furnace to heat
            water in a boiler. The hot water passes through pipes to a
            radiator that warms the room. This type of system is not
            used commonly today, but it may be found in older homes.
            Most heating systems are controlled with
            a thermostat, which can be set to maintain
            a specified temperature. Thermostats for
            small systems are often programmable to accommodate needs according to the time of
            day or the use of the building.</p>

          <p>Interior furnishings must never obstruct
            heat registers or cold air returns. Where
            draperies hang to the floor, clear plastic deflectors can be placed over a vent or register
            that channel or direct the hot air into the room.</p>

          <p>Ventilation and air-conditioning are interrelated terms. Ventilation refers to natural
            breezes or air currents from open windows
            and doors. The designer must be aware that
            window treatments and furniture placement
            should allow for, and not obstruct, desired
            natural ventilation.
            Ventilation may sufficiently cool the interior for most of the year,
            supplemented by air-conditioning only in the
            hottest seasons. However, hot, arid, or humid
            regions rely heavily on air-conditioning for
            livable comfort for much of the year.</p>

            <h3>Acoustics</h3>
          </header>

          <p>Also integral to the planning of space is the need to control noise through the shape of the interior
            space
            and the materials selected for walls, windows, ceilings, and flooring. In most contract interiors where
            many
            people walk
            or meet, noise control is imperative. Here are some tools
            through which acoustics are controlled:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p> Rough materials as opposed to smooth materials. Even
                hard surfaces, if they are substantially textured with
                high/low relief or are rough-hewn, will refract sound.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Shape and volume of space can be planned to break up
                noise level.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Materials that are part of the interior package: carpeting, wall materials, window treatments, and
                furnishings will have a great deal to do with the quality and
                control of acoustics. Carpeting and textile applications
                absorb sound.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>In large concert halls, churches, or public areas where
                sound needs to be evenly distributed and enhanced,
                acoustic specialists plan for the exact length, width,
                and height of the space, the specific shapes of the floors, walls, and ceilings, and materials that
                will
                perfectly balance absorption and reflection of sound
                waves. This is done through mathematical equations
                and formulas.</p>
