      <h2>FORCES ON HIGH-RISE STRUCTURES</h2>
    </header>

    <h3>Gravity Loads</h3>

    <p>The vertical components carrying the vertical gravity loads
      of a high-rise structure, such as columns, core shafts, and
      bearing walls, need to be strengthened over the full height
      of the building due to the accumulating nature of the loads
      from the roof level down to the foundation. The quantity of
      structural materials therefore necessarily increases as the
      number of stories of a high-rise building increases.</p>

    <p>The increase in weight for gravity loads is much greater
      for concrete than for steel-framed high-rise structures. This
      increase can be an advantage since the dead weight of
      the concrete structure assists in resisting the overturning
      effects of wind forces. On the other hand, the larger
      mass of a concrete building can be a liability during an
      earthquake, producing a greater overall lateral force during
      the seismic event.</p>

    <p>In contrast to the vertical gravity-load-carrying elements,
      which need strengthening, the horizontal spanning floor
      and roof systems for high-rise structures are similar to
      those for low- and medium-rise buildings. The spanning
      members of the floor and roof systems help to tie
      the vertical structure together and serve as horizontal
      diaphragms. The most common floor system for steel-
      framed high-rise structures is corrugated metal decking
      with a lightweight concrete fill. This provides spaces for
      the distribution of power and communication wiring as
      well as small service ducts throughout the floor.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/High Rise Structures/Gravity Loads.png" alt="HIGH RISE STRUCTURES"

    <p>In reinforced concrete high-rise structures, it can be
      economical to use a framework of beams and girders
      supporting a lightweight structural concrete slab.</p>

    <p>Trussed joists for long-span designs can be economical,
      even if the floor systems are deeper than normal. The
      mechanical systems can pass through the open web areas
      of the joists without any additional floor depth required
      below the bottom chord of the trusses.</p>

    <p>In residential high-rise buildings, a post-tensioned flat
      slab design is often used for spans not exceeding 25 to
      30 feet (7.6 to 9.1 m) with slab thicknesses in the range
      of 6 to 7 inches (150 to 180) or at most 8 inches (205). The
      flat slabs are supported directly by columns without any
      supporting beams, resulting in minimal structural floor
      depth. However, any mechanical and electrical services
      would have to be suspended below the slab.</p>

                transmitted to the central core and directed
                down to the foundation. Again, this represents
                a system where all gravity and lateral loads are
                essentially resisted by the core.</b></p>

    <p>In designing for safety, the aim is to reduce the likelihood
      of building collapse from wind and seismic forces.
      Secondarily, consideration must be given to the potential
      failure of cladding materials, architectural elements,
      utilities, and services.</p>

    <p>Except for high-risk seismic zones, wind is the force that
      most affects the design of high-rise buildings. Wind
      loads acting on the overall structure are generally given
      as stepped increments of wind pressure, increasing in
      magnitude as the height above ground increases. These
      wind loads are assumed to act normal to the vertical
      surfaces of the building, with consideration also given to
      the effect of quartering wind.</p>

    <p>Under a steady wind, a high-rise structure deflects like a
      vertical cantilever beam that is fixed at the ground level.
      However, wind gusts on the building can oscillate and
      the smaller modal deflections can also cause vibrations
      in the building. Small oscillations may contribute to
      some occupants feeling uncomfortable and insecure. The
      inherent stiffness and damping characteristics of most
      high-rise buildings preclude the possibility of wind-induced
      resonance and aerodynamic instability.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/High Rise Structures/FORCES ON HIGH_RISE STRUCTURES 1.png"

      <figcaption>
        <p><b>In multistory structures, lateral
            loads from wind and earthquakes
            are distributed to each of the floor
            or diaphragm levels. At any given
            floor or roof level, there must
            be a requisite number of braced
            or shear walls to transfer the
            cumulative lateral shear forces
            from the diaphragms above.</b></p>
      </figcaption>
    </figure> <br><br>

    <p>Seismic movements in a building are different from those
      produced by wind. Under catastrophic earthquakes, a
      building will deflect much more and may deflect in random
      directions, with the challenge of avoiding movements
      large enough to produce collapse.</p>

    <p>The critical periods
      of vibration of earthquakes are generally in the range of
      fractions of a second while the period for flexible high-rise
      buildings will be several seconds. When the earthquake
      period is kept out of phase from the building period, the
      possibility of harmonic resonance is lessened. Harmonic
      resonance increases the amplitude of the displacement
      and can result in catastrophic movement.</p>

    <p>Tall buildings
      are designed to be relatively rigid under wind loading
      but certain parts of the structure may be allowed to yield
      or crack locally under earthquake loads to lengthen the
      building's period of vibration and increase its damping
      capability. This is done to resist catastrophic failure for
      very strong earthquakes. The ductility requirement for
      seismic design involves equipping buildings with reserve
      strength—through plastic yielding beyond the elastic
      limit—so that the building can sway without losing its
      structural integrity.</p>

    <figure>

    <p>In tall buildings, the overturning moment
      due to lateral loading is significant. It is
      advantageous for the floor system to distribute
      a major part of the gravity load of the building
      to the exterior resisting elements in order
      to stabilize them by precompression against
      tensile overturning force requirements.</p>

    <p>This
      can be achieved by eliminating as many
      interior columns as possible and using long-
      span floor systems capable of spanning from
      the central core to the exterior columns. This
      stronger floor can also make an appropriate
      contribution to resisting lateral shear forces.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/High Rise Structures/FORCES ON HIGH_RISE STRUCTURES 3.png"
        alt="HIGH RISE STRUCTURES" style="height: 24%; width: 51%;">
      <figcaption>
        <p><b>FORCES ON HIGH-RISE STRUCTURES</b></p>
      </figcaption>
    </figure> <br><br>

    <p>A cap truss or outriggers at the roof level, tied to the core
      and combined with the exterior tie-down columns, serve
      to reduce the overturning moment and lateral drift in the
      building. The tie-downs are attached at every story and
      support gravity loads in addition to restraining the lateral
      movement of the frame.</p>

    <p>A variation of the cap truss and tie-down
      concept is the use of outriggers at various
      levels in the height of the building. The core
      is often centrally located with outriggers
      extending on both sides. When the shear core
      tries to bend, the outriggers act as lever arms
      that place direct axial loads, tension on one
      face and compression on the other, into the
      perimeter columns.</p>

    <p>These columns, in turn,
      act as struts to resist the deflection of the
      core. The outriggers generally are in the form
      of trusses in steel-frame structures or walls in
      reinforced concrete structures, or they may be
      a composite assembly of steel and concrete.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/High Rise Structures/FORCES ON HIGH_RISE STRUCTURES 4.jpg"
        alt="HIGH RISE STRUCTURES" style="height: 24%; width: 51%;">

        <p><b>FORCES ON HIGH-RISE STRUCTURES</b></p>

    </figure> <br><br>

    <p>Any lateral load applied at a distance above grade
      generates an overturning moment at the base of a
      structure. For equilibrium, the overturning moment must be
      counterbalanced by an external restoring moment and an
      internal resisting moment provided by forces developed in
      column members and shear walls. Tall, slender buildings
      with a high aspect (height-to-base width) ratio experience
      larger horizontal deflections at their tops and are especially
      susceptible to overturning moments.</p>

    <p>While torsion may be present in buildings of any height,
      it can be particularly critical in high-rise structures. Due to
      the extreme height of high-rise buildings, a story torsion
      that would normally be considered acceptable in low-
      and midrise buildings can accumulate over many stories
      to cause a total rotation for the high-rise that would be
      unacceptable. The motions associated with torsion can add
      to the swaying motion along the building's axes, creating
      unacceptable translations and accelerations.</p>

    <figure>

    <p>Multistory structures are generally braced with a minimum
      of four lateral-force-resisting planes per story, each wall
      being positioned to minimize torsional moments and
      displacement. Although it is desirable to position the
      lateral resisting planes in the same position at each floor
      level, it is not always necessary. </p>

    <p>The transfer of shear
      through any one level may be examined as an isolated
      problem. Torsional resistance is maximized by positioning
      lateral-force-resisting systems and cores in a balanced,
      symmetrical manner. This minimizes the possibility of the
      building's center of mass being offset or eccentric from its
      center of rigidity or resistance.</p>

    <p>Torsional resistance is enhanced by configuring braced
      frames, moment frames, or shear walls into a complete
      tube. Circulation cores using reinforced concrete or steel
      framing are also more effective when closed.</p>

    <p>The proper choice of a lateral-force-resisting system
      can make or break a high-rise project in terms of
      constructibility, usefulness, and economics.</p>

    <ul>
      <p>We can divide high-rise structures into two categories,
        based on the dominant location of the vertical lateral-
        resisting systems: interior structures and exterior

      <p>Interior structures are high-rise structures that resist lateral
        loads primarily through lateral-force-resisting elements
        located within the interior of the structure, such as a rigid
        frame structure of steel or concrete, or a structure braced
        by a core consisting of braced frames, moment frames, or
        shear walls constructed into a closed system that acts as a
        structural tube.</p>

      <li>
        <h3>Exterior Structures</h3>
      </li>

      <p>Exterior structures are high-rise structures that resist
        lateral loads primarily through lateral-force-resisting
        elements located along the perimeter of the structure.</p>
