            <h2>Radiant Floor Systems</h2>
          </header>
          <p>Whenever a floor is being installed in an interior, the designer has the opportunity to include
            a radiant floor system to aid in the environmental heating of the space. Radiant floors offer
            multiple advantages:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>They operate silently</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>eliminate visible sources of heat (such as vents
                and louvers) that need to be coordinated with the design.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>energy efficient and thus reduce
                overall heating costs.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>and generate none of the dust and other particles spread by forced-air
                systems.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p> radiant floor systems provide an even distribution of heat throughout a
                space, not just at localized points. This even heat feels more comfortable and can reduce the
                overall temperature settings. </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>It should be noted that radiant systems-which are typically provided with concrete floors-
            also exist for other floor types, such as wood and other plank systems, as well as carpet and
            vinyl finishes. Keep in mind that naturally insulating materials can reduce the efficiency of a
            radiant system. Wood systems, moreover, should be engineered, as heat through solid wood
            flooring can cause the floor to shrink and crack. </p>

        </div> <br><br>

        <div>
          <ul>
            <h4>Calculations and Costs</h4>
            <p>Floor materials are calculated and priced per square foot or square yard:</p>

            <li>
              <p>Hard materials such as stone, wood, wood combined with another material, and some tiles are
                calculated
                per square foot and are costly, although they are also very durable.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Sheet vinyl and carpeting are calculated per square yard and cost less than most hard materials,
                though
                they are less durable. To find the square footage, multiply the room's width by its length (in
                feet).
                Divide this figure by 9 to find the square yardage (9 square feet in 1 square yard). Because roll
                goods
                (vinyl and carpet) must be installed all in the same direction with no quarter turns, roll goods are
                “plotted” on a floor plan to determine exact widths and cuts (vinyl is usually 6 feet wide; carpet,
                12
                feet wide). </p>
            </li>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Each cut (width) is multiplied by its length and then divided to determine the yardage to be
                  ordered.
                  Installation costs for stone and tile are high and figured per square foot according to the
                  charges of
                  the installer ($6 or more per square foot—pr/sq/ft). </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Wood installation is also costly and is charged by the square foot ($4 or more pr/sq/ft). Wood
                  may
                  need professional finishing (acrylic or polyurethane), and brick may need a sealant. Carpet costs
                  are
                  figured per square yard and generally include pad or underlay and installation (using the tackless
                  strip method or the direct glue-down method) at $8 and up. Flooring materials are divided into
                  three
                  categories—hard (nonresilient), resilient, and soft. </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Nonresilient flooring materials include brick, concrete, stone, tile, and wood. </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Resilient flooring materials are asphalt tile, cork, fabric, leather, linoleum, rubber, and
                  vinyl.
                  Soft floor coverings include wall-to-wall carpeting and a wide selection of area rugs.</p>

            <h3>Guidelines for Selecting Hard and Resilient Floor Materials</h3>
          </header>
          <ul>
            <p>Hard and resilient floor materials form a substantial part of the character of an interior. The
              integrity
              of flooring is so important that it is impossible to create successful interiors if the flooring
              appears
              to be cheap, a poor imitation, or of poor design or quality. Flooring is not only a background but
              also a
              material that will provide years of satisfaction in terms of beauty, durability, and upkeep. With that
              in
              mind, it is wise to select flooring according to the following criteria:</p>

            <li>
              <p>Beauty means good design merit and integrity. Flooring should be appealing even if there were no
                other
                furnishings in the interior.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Harmony as a background for a variety of furnishing styles over time. Look for neutralized colors,
                subtle textures, and lack of a definite pattern.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Graceful aging in the form of a patina, or mellowing of the finish through continued use. Permanent
                flooring is often in place for 10 or 20 years, and many historic interiors that have stood the test
                of
                time feature hard materials that have lasted and continued to be beautiful for a century or more.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Subfloor preparation supports and enhances the finishing material. Thin resilient floors such as
                vinyl
                require a smooth subfloor, or irregularities will show through the finish flooring. Heavy materials
                such
                as stone, tile, or brick require a sturdy subfloor, which will raise the floor level.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Life-cycle costing is the total cost divided by the number of years of expected use. Surprisingly,
                more
                costly products often have a lower life-cycle cost because they don't require replacing.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Upkeep means maintenance frequency and ease of cleaning. Hard flooring materials generally require
                less
                care than resilient ones. Surfaces with grooves or indentations tend to trap dirt. Natural materials
                are
                superior at camouflaging tracked-in soil.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Durability is the ability to withstand traffic. Particularly in high-traffic areas, avoid flooring
                materials that are vulnerable to wear.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Safety. Smooth hard resilient floorings without added texture are slippery, especially when wet. To
                avoid accidents due to visual confusion, flooring should avoid glare, three-dimensional patterns, or
                abrupt pattern changes that would create a depth illusion. Strollers, wheelchairs, and walkers
                operate
                best on flooring with a medium texture; avoid extremes of rugged textures (including deep carpet
                pile)
                or highly polished smooth hard materials.</p>

          <ul>
            <p>Hard floor materials, such as brick, concrete, stone, and tile, have several advantages.</p>
            <p>Generally these materials have the following characteristics:</p>

            <li>
              <p>Strong and durable</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Nonabsorbent and relatively impervious to soiling and staining</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Easy to maintain and clean</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Timeless—'classics' with aesthetic appeal that lasts indefinitely</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Versatile—adaptable for use in formal or informal, structural or decorative, textured or patterned
                interiors</p>
            </li>


            <li>
              <p>Able to serve as structure as well as finish materials Disadvantages of hard materials include the
                following:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>High initial cost—although the life-cycle cost is often comparatively low.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Subfloor preparation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Rigidity—a hazard for objects (and people) that may fall on the hard surface.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Chilliness—hard materials tend to be cold to the touch unless heated artificially or by
                    sunshine.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Acoustic “liveness”—being nonporous, hard materials reflect sound and amplify noise. This
                    effect is
                    often mitigated by using hard materials as a background for softer, sound-absorbing area rugs.

                  </p>
                  <p>The hardest and typically the most expensive of the stones. May be cut into thin sheets or
                    slabs.
                    Can be polished to a high sheen. Cold to the touch. Terrazzo is a composite flooring of broken
                    chips
                    of marble set into cement and polished to a sheen. May be tiles or poured as a solid floor. This
                    is
                    a practical use of marble, since up to 50 percent waste occurs from break-age at the quarry.</p>

              <h3>Solid Wood Flooring</h3>

              <p>Solid wood flooring, as its name suggests, is prepared from wood that is one piece from top
                to bottom. It takes stains and other finishes well and can be easily refinished. Because it is
                prone to damage from water and moisture, this flooring should be used on the ground floor
                and above only. It comes in several cuts. </p>

              <ul>

                <li>
                  <h5>Plainsawn:</h5>
                  <p>This most common cut of lumber provides the maximum yield. Plainsawn boards
                    have a great variation in grain, as the direction of the cut makes growth rings more obvious.
                    They add a unique texture to a wood floor. </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <h5>Quartersawn:</h5>
                  <p>Cut at a 60- to 90-degree angle to center of the lumber, it yields less footage
                    than plainsawn. Quartersawn boards have more parallel grain. They hold stains and other
                    painted finishes well and create a homogenous wood floor. </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <h5>Riftsawn:</h5>
                  <p>Cut at a 30- to 60-degree angle to center of the lumber, it is otherwise similar to
                    quartersawn. </p>

                <li>
                  <h5>Engineered Flooring: </h5>
                  <p>Made of built-up layers with the wood grain running in opposite direc-
                    tions, engineered flooring is available in three-, five- and ten-ply. It is more dimensionally
                    stable than solid wood and, as such, is better suited for highly trafficked areas. It can also
                    be
                    installed directly over a concrete subfloor. Engineered flooring is found in basements,
                    kitchens,
                    bathrooms, and utility rooms. </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <h5>Acrylic-Impregnated Flooring:</h5>
                  <p>Acrylic injected into the wood creates an extremely durable and
                    hard finish. It is used in restaurants and malls, and sometimes in residential projects. </p>

                  <h5>End Grain Flooring: </h5>
                  <p>Made of wood cut perpendicular to the grain and sized to specific dimen-
                    sions, end grain flooring is very resistant to damage and can be used in high-impact conditions.
                    The
                    exposed grain provides a unique design element, but it is also easily stained to a
                    variety of colors. End grain is suitable to all applications, from residential to warehousing.

                  <p>Wood flooring can be installed in many ways, and designers should consider the location
                    before deciding on the type of flooring. A natural material, wood expands and contracts with
                    changes in climate and moisture. Allowing for ventilation under the floor and expansion at the
                    perimeters is essential. </p>

                    7
                    feet in length. Random-plank widths range from 3 to 8 inches, typically installed in three
                    varying
                    sizes. Strips and random plank are tongue and groove to fit snugly together. Parquet is strips
                    or
                    squares set into shapes.</p>

                <li>
                  <p>Maintenance. Depends on the finish: Oiled or waxed wood will need protection against moisture,
                    require dust mopping frequently, and need rewaxing. </p>

                <li>
                  <p>Description. Bamboo flooring is a rapidly renewable resource made from hollow round shoots of
                    the
                    bamboo Asian grass plant that matures in three years, regenerates without need for replanting,
                    and
                    requires minimal fertilization or pesticides. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Although it is not wood, bamboo flooring is categorized with hardwood flooring. Bamboo is
                    attractive because it is very hard, strong, and dimensionally stable. Bamboo floors provide a
                    very
                    rich visual texture, with thin strips of varying color interrupted by the bamboo nodes. It
                    installs
                    similar to standard hardwood flooring.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Applications. Residential and contract flooring where green products are desirable.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Maintenance. Comparable to wood flooring.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Cost structure. Slightly more expensive than flooring from domestic hardwoods.</p>

            <h3>Resilient Floor Materials</h3>
          </header>
          <ul>
            <p>Resilient materials have flexibility, or give. These include cork, fabric, leather, rubber, and most
              vinyl's-Like hard materials, resilient floor materials have common sets of advantages and
              disadvantages.
              The advantages of resilient flooring are as follows:</p>
            <h4>Advantages of resilient flooring include the following:</h4>
            <li>
              <p>Initial cost is generally lower than that for hard materials.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Resilient floor materials are warmer to the touch.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>By absorbing more sound, they produce quieter, more comforting interiors.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>They are easier on the body for standing and thereby produce less fatigue.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Items dropped are less likely to break, and less damage is done to the floor itself because of its
                ability to give (resilience).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>There is a wide variety of designs or patterns, colors, and even visual textures (particularly in
                the
                vinyl flooring types).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The maintenance is moderate, depending on the finish and the durability of the finish.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <h4>Disadvantages of resilient flooring include the following:</h4>
            <li>
              <p>They may require more maintenance and cleaning if the surface has no protection or as a no-wax
                surface
                treatment wears off.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Resilient floors can be damaged, dented, or torn by dropping sharp objects such as kitchen knives
                or by
                dragging furniture or appliances across the surface.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Resilient floorings are less durable than hard floor materials, making them a costly choice in the
                long
                run due to the necessity of replacement.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>If poorly installed, seams will open and become worn.</p>

                    <p>Maintenance. Most sheet vinyl is given a no-wax surface to help maintain a shiny surface.
                      However, heavy traffic, furniture movement, and detergents may remove the shine. Damp mopping
                      with
                      a water and vinegar solution will help keep the shine. Vinyl floors may be waxed.</p>

            <h3>Carpeting</h3>

            <p>Carpet, particularly wall-to-wall installed carpet, has become a standard item in interior design.
              The
              use
              and placement of broadloom carpet (12 feet wide on average) is restricted only by the aesthetic and
              maintenance requirements of the room. Carpets are made in many fibers and in a wide selection of
              colors,
              textures, and prices. The quality of the carpet and how well it will wear can be difficult to
              determine
              when examining the store sample. </p>

            <p>The small size of most carpet samples also makes it hard to visualize the effect of an entire area
              covered in that carpet.</p>
            <ul>

              <li>
                <p>Many carpet companies divide their product lines into residential and commercial applications.
                  This
                  distinction may seem obvious at first, but the material properties and qualities of
                  carpets for each differ in their requirements for installation and maintenance. </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Residential Carpet
                  In choosing carpets for residential projects,designers should consider the following:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>the amount of traffic on the floor</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>the adjacency of the floor to natural light</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>and the transition from the carpet to hard or resilient flooring</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Carpets in residential applications must
                      also take into account the specific users of
                      a space</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Commercial Carpet </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Commercial carpets need to withstand the
                      use of several times the number of people
                      as in a residential application</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>need to perform under the stress
                      loads of equipment such as luggage, wheel-
                      chairs, and other transport devices; low-cut
                      pile with a dense construction is the correct
                      choice for these areas</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Cut piles, especially
                      high density, are well suited to concealing
                      traffic lines and the dirt that can accumulate
                      in areas of high activity</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>They are also recommended for offices, reception areas, and
                      boardrooms in a work environment. </p>

                    <p>Foot Traffic: Number of times per day a carpet is walked on by a single occupant. Light

              <p>The following guidelines may be helpful:</p>
              <li>
                <p>Understand the fibers used in carpeting and the advantages and disadvantages of each.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Learn carpet constructions and the selection of textures available.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Look for guarantees against flaws (holes, streaks, color variations) or after-installation
                  problems
                  (such as fading, premature crushing, or pile loss).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Purchase locally from carpet dealers known for business integrity, quality installation, and
                  service.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Compare quality. Poor-quality, inexpensive carpets can appear similar to moderately priced
                  carpets
                  yet have inferior-quality yarns, less latex glue to hold the primary and secondary backing
                  together
                  (see 'Tufted Broadloom Carpets'), and other compromises not immediately apparent. These carpets
                  will
                  wear out faster and need replacing much sooner, thereby costing more than a good-quality carpet.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Ask for recommendations from sales personnel for carpets that will stand up to wear and traffic.
                  See
                  if there is a written guarantee of quality and durability.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Determine quality with hand tests. Bend back the face of a tufted carpet to reveal the primary
                  backing. This is called making the carpet "grin." If a lot of primary backing is exposed, the
                  tufts
                  are not close together and the carpet will likely mat or crush under traffic. </p>
                <p>When close together or dense, the carpet will have better resilience. Also try untwisting the
                  pile to
                  see if it may become fuzzy, and pull the pile to determine if the face will lose fibers.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Take the carpet sample to the site where it will be installed. Evaluate color during different
                  times
                  of the day and at night with artificial light, and walk on it to determine whether it will show
                  footprints or crush easily. Drop thread or other debris on the surface and evaluate whether it
                  will
                  readily show soil.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Select color wisely. For a heavy-traffic area, select a color medium in value (not too light or
                  too
                  dark) and low in intensity (fairly dull). This will hide the shadows and soiling caused by foot
                  traffic. Patterned carpet will increase the life span of a carpet under heavy use because pattern
                  can
                  effectively hide both soil and wear.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Compare the carpet's life span to its aesthetics. A vivid or demanding color may prove tiresome
                  sooner than would a more neutralized carpet. Neutrals and neutralized colors are flexible for
                  redecorating, which may take place several times during the life span of a carpet.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Select a quality padding or underlay, and check to see that the padding delivered to the site is
                  the
                  one you selected.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>The quality of installation may determine how the carpet looks, lays, and performs. Insist on the
                  most highly skilled carpet installers that can be hired in your vicinity.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Upgrade carpeting to a better quality than the standard allotment for carpet in new construction.
                  Lower-quality carpeting costs more in the long run because it will wear out quickly and require
                  replacement and labor to remove and install.</p>

              <h4>Carpet Fibers</h4>
            </header>
            <p>Most carpets are constructed of a single fiber, such as nylon. However, there are an increasing
              number of
              carpets made of blended fibers, such as 65 percent wool and 35 percent acrylic, or 80 percent nylon
              and 20
              percent wool or polyester. </p>

            <ol>
              <p>These and other blends are popular for three reasons:</p>
              <li>
                <p>A blend has the positive qualities of each fiber; it is durable and may be pleasing to the touch.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>A more costly fiber can be extended with the combination of less expensive fibers.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Cross-dyeing effects can be obtained by coloring the yarn with a single dyestuff—the two
                  different
                  fibers take the dye differently, creating a two-tone effect.</p>
              </li>

                    coarse,
                    as well as varying in length. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Shorter staple lengths are used in lesser-quality and longer staple lengths in higher-quality
                    wool
                    carpets. Wool may be dyed any color or left in natural white, cream, brown, or gray, as are
                    berber
                    carpets.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Advantages. Long a standard of comparison as a durable carpet fiber, wool is resilient due to
                    its
                    overlapping scale, giving it long life and resistance to crushing. It takes dyes beautifully and
                    is
                    woven and tufted into carpets of high quality. It is used in pile for Oriental, folk, and
                    designer
                    rugs.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Disadvantages. Wool carpets must be treated for moth resistance. When wet, wool emits a
                    distinctive
                    animal smell. Some people are allergic to wool. It is susceptible to fuzzing (fibers working
                    loose)
                    and pilling (fibers working into small balls or pills). </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Wool is the most costly of the carpet fibers.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Maintenance. Wool should be vacuumed regularly and spots cleaned immediately. Wool takes a long
                    time to dry but may be wet cleaned. Professional dry-cleaning methods are recommended. Avoid
                    scrubbing brushes that could untwist the pile or encourage pilling.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Cost structure. High.</p>

            <li>
              <h4>Nylon</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Source. A manufactured synthetic based on the raw materials phenol, hydrogen, oxygen, and
                    nitrogen.
                    Nylon is heated into a solution and then extruded into long threads that may be texturized and
                    cut
                    into staple (short fibers) to meet requirements of the many textures found in nylon carpet.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Advantages. Nylon is the most widely used carpet fiber, accounting for over 90 percent of all
                    carpeting sold alone or combined with other fibers. A flexible fiber used for level-loop carpets
                    and
                    cut piles, both tufted and woven, and used often for accent or scatter rugs. Nylon is strong,
                    durable, resilient, and abrasion resistant, has good color retention, hides dirt, and has
                    excellent
                    bulk. There is a minimum of fuzzing and pilling; it is nonallergenic and mildew and insect
                    resistant. It also has good flame resistance.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Disadvantages. First- and second-generation (chemical composition) nylons are prone to static
                    electricity and have a harsh sheen and unpleasant touch. However, these weaknesses have been
                    overcome. Fifth-generation nylons are guaranteed against stains and soiling. However, there are
                    many
                    quality levels of nylon, and some of these problems may still exist.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Maintenance. Nylon cleans exceptionally well. It should be vacuumed regularly and spot cleaned
                    as
                    needed. Both steam, or wet, and dry, or chemical, cleaning are effective. Accent or scatter rugs
                    may
                    be machine washed and dried.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Cost structure. Moderate.</p>
                </li>

            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Oleﬁn/Polypropylene</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Source. Olefin and polypropylene carpets are made of ethylene or propane gas constituted into a
                    synthetic long-chain polymer. Polypropylenes are modified olefins.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Advantages. Olefin is lightweight, inexpensive, durable, and strong. It resists fuzzing,
                    pilling,
                    and abrasion. Used for indoor and outdoor carpeting, contract carpeting, and carpet tiles. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Also used for artificial turf.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Disadvantages. Olefin is less soft to the touch. Must be treated for resistance to sunlight
                    fading
                    and deterioration. Tends to crush, pill, and stain. Less durable than nylon.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Maintenance. Vacuum regularly. Cleans well; is unaffected by moisture and most chemicals and
                    acids.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Cost structure. Low to moderate.</p>
                </li>

              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Polyester</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Source. Polyester is a synthetic long-chain polymer derived from a reaction between
                    dicarboxylic
                    acid and dihydric alcohol.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Advantages. Polyester takes and holds dyes well. Next to acrylic, it most closely resembles
                    wool
                    because of its dye ability and softness. Polyester is mildew and moth resistant, nonallergenic,
                    and
                    nonabsorbent. It is a durable fiber that resists fuzzing and pilling. Polyester is soft and cool
                    to
                    the touch.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Disadvantages. Polyester crushes easily and must be heat-set to maintain yarn twist. Heat-set
                    polyesters are good selections for residential areas with light traffic. Polyester lacks warmth
                    and
                    tends to hold oil-borne stains.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Cost structure. Moderate to moderately high, depending on the quality of the fiber.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Acrylic</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Source. Acrylic is a synthetic fiber composed mainly of acrylonitrile and can be texturized and
                    cut
                    into staple fibers and spun into a bulky yarn.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Advantages. Acrylic is the fiber that is most similar to wool. It looks like wool, so it is
                    often
                    combined with wool to lower the cost. It is soft and warm to the touch. Acrylic is often used to
                    imitate
                    wool berber carpet.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Disadvantages. Acrylic has low resilience, mats easily, and fuzzes and pills. It has a
                    relatively
                    short
                    life span compared to wool or nylon, but its life span increases dramatically when blended with
                    either
                    of these two fibers. Acrylic is vulnerable to oil-borne stains, which are difficult to remove.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Maintenance. Acrylic responds well to wet cleaning, but care must be taken to avoid brushing
                    and
                    untwisting the fibers, as they will mat down and pill more easily when they have been loosened.
                    Vacuum
                    regularly and remove spots immediately.</p>

            <h3>Woven Broadloom Carpet</h3>
          </header>

          <ul>
            <p>Broadloom carpets are woven or tufted by machine and are typically 12 feet wide. </p>

            <li>
              <p>A Wilton carpet is woven on the Jacquard loom. It allows complex patterns to be constructed, and
                each
                color is carried as a separate weft or bank of yarns beneath the face of the design, making Wilton
                carpets heavy and substantial. </p>
              <p>Wiltons are nearly always of quality wool and are very costly. They are seen most often in
                exclusive
                areas of contract interior design.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Axminster carpets are also Jacquard woven but without the extra warps. Only the colors needed are
                inserted, making complex patterns possible without great expense. Axminster carpets are of wool or
                nylon
                and are seen in many kinds of contract settings such as restaurants, theaters, retail businesses,
                and
                hotels. </p>
              <p>Axminster carpets are readily adaptable to custom design, and in cases where they are still cost
                prohibitive, carpeting can be printed to imitate the design.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Velvet weave carpets are also woven but without any design. They may be solid or woven of
                variegated
                yarn, usually of wool or a wool and nylon blend.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Tufted Broadloom Carpets</h4>
          <p>Tufted carpets make up the majority of carpets today. They are constructed on a loom that employs
            multiple
            needles threaded with the yarn. The carpet yarn is punched into the primary backing in a zigzag pattern,
            which holds the yarn in place in case of a loose tuft that is pulled. The tufts are held securely with a
            latex coating (rubber-based glue) that also holds on a secondary backing of polypropylene.</p>

          <p>Some tufted carpets have no secondary backing, and custom hand-tufted area rugs have a layer of latex
            to
            which is affixed a loosely woven scrim textile that adds some stability to the construction.
            Rubber-backed
            tufted carpets are tufted into a thick rubber-cushioned backing and directly glued to the surface.
            Fuse-bonded carpets (such as artificial turf) are tufted into a heavy layer of latex and are also
            directly
            glued down without padding. There are many levels of quality in the construction of tufted carpets.</p>

          <ul>
            <h4>Other Carpet Constructions</h4>
            <li>
              <p>Knitted carpets are constructed of knitted yarns held together with a latex backing. They account
                for
                very few carpets on the market.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Needlepunch carpets are masses of fibers (rather than yarns) that are held together by an
                interlocking
                fiber-punching machine. They are inexpensive and durable and come in yardage and square tiles with
                or
                without a latex backing. They may be installed over a pad or glued down directly.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <h4>Carpet Textures</h4>
            <p>Carpet texture means the pile surface. Yarns are cut or looped, fi ne or bulky, one level or
              multilevel:
            </p>
            <li>
              <p>Cut-pile surfaces are sheared to one height or multilevel. This term encompasses all textures that
                are
                not loop textures.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Plush carpets are cut pile, densely tufted (close together) and with a short pile. Residential
                plush
                carpeting is typically one solid color; it tends to show traffic and vacuum marks, which emphasize
                the
                plush quality that imitates the density of Oriental rugs. Contract plush carpeting can also be
                two-tone
                or subtle patterns, which hide wear.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Frieze (fri-zay') yarns are tightly twisted, for greater resilience. Many residential frieze
                carpets
                are slightly two-toned and referred to as “trackless” since they hide dirt and footprints. Frieze is
                physically and visually a durable carpet texture.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Sculptured multilevel textures consist of various levels of cut pile or of loops (also called multi
                loop or embossed loop). They may also be tufted of variegated yarn (colors vary), producing a type
                of
                random pattern. </p>
              <p>Deep sculpturing of cut pile, seen in some residential carpeting, can weaken the resilience,
                whereas
                tightly tufted carpet with understated sculpturing (contract) can be very strong and resilient.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Deep-pile or shag carpets have returned to the residential market. Quality deep-pile carpets are
                tufted
                tightly and are both durable and luxurious. They are an “upgrade” carpet, costing more than a
                typical
                cut-pile carpet.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Level loop, also called round-wire construction, is the most common short-pile contract carpeting.
                Yarns are looped over wires for uniformity and then the wires are removed. Level-loop textures are
                strong, durable, and resilient but not soft to the touch.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Random or level-tip is a contract short pile of cut and loop texture in which the cut pile is the
                same
                height as the loops, creating a more plush texture with the strength of level-loop textures.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Contract carpet textures are often used in residential interiors where durability, strength, and
                longevity are more important than luxury and softness. Applications often include hallways, stairs,
                home
                offices, family rooms, and perhaps children's rooms.</p>
            </li>

              <h3>Installation Methods and Padding</h3>
            </header>
            <p>Carpet can be installed according to two basic methods.</p>
            <ul>
              <p>Direct glue-down uses no separate cushion and is suitable for any type of carpet. Reasons for
                direct
                glue-down include:</p>
              <li>
                <p>Averting potentially dangerous ripples, which are a hazard in high-traffic and especially
                  contract
                  installations</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Saving the expense of the pad, tackless strip, and labor to install two layers</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Doing installations where no softness is required Pad and tackless strip uses a pad attached to a
                  thin board with tacks that protrude toward the wall. The pad is stapled, nailed, or glued down.
                  Using
                  equipment that stretches the carpet, the installer hooks the carpet over the tacks and then pounds
                  the
                  tacks into the carpet. </p>
                <p>The padding for this method is available in several types, listed here in order of popularity:
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Urethane foam is made from synthetic polymers in varying thicknesses. It may be formed to be
                  extra
                  dense.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Chopped urethane, or rebond, is bonded into sheets with additives such as paper, vinyl,
                  fabric-backed
                  foam, or wood chips. This factor makes bonded foam subject to various quality levels.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Foam rubber pads are firm, flat sheets made from natural or synthetic rubbers. They are suitable
                  for
                  medium traffic.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Sponge rubber pads combine natural and synthetic rubber and fillers to form a flat or a waffle
                  sponge, suitable for light to medium traffic. With age and wear, rubber will disintegrate.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Felt padding was originally animal hair. Though animal-hair felt padding is now rare, a
                  combination
                  felt padding made of some animal hair and some synthetic fibers is more common, while fiber felt
                  padding is all synthetic. Felt is firmer than other padding materials, making it an excellent
                  substrate for Oriental rugs, whose backing can be damaged by too much resilience.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>

              <figcaption>Tackless strips are nailed next to the wall, then
                padding or underlay is stapled down (if subﬂ oor is wood), and
                carpet backing is hooked into angled staples to anchor it securely to the ﬂ oor.</figcaption>

            <h3>Carpet Maintenance and Cleaning</h3>
          </header>
          <p>The appearance and life span of a carpet often depend on the way it is maintained. Although heavy
            traffic
            will wear carpet out faster, keeping the carpet clean is a key to good looks and to increasing its life
            span. Soil allowed to stay on the surface of a carpet is not only unsightly; the longer it is left, the
            more
            difficult it is to remove. When dirt, grit, or sand settles to the bottom of the pile, it can abrade the
            yarns at the base, wear them off, and eventually destroy the carpet.</p>

          <p>In heavy-traffic areas such as hallways and rooms that contain traffic lanes, carpeting should be
            vacuumed
            every day. </p>

          <p>Areas of little traffic, such as bedrooms, usually require vacuuming only once a week. A light
            vacuuming is
            three times back and forth, and a thorough vacuuming is seven times back and forth. Repetitive vacuuming
            loosens and pulls the dirt from the base to the surface and then sucks it up into the machine.</p>

          <p>Spots should be removed as quickly as possible and never allowed to remain on the carpet long enough to
            become set. </p>

          <p>Mild detergent and clear water are useful for many stains, and oil- or tar-based stains can be removed
            with
            a commercially prepared dry-cleaning solution. Carpet stores will often recommend products or sell kits
            for
            cleaning spots.</p>

          <p>Carpets should be cleaned when they become so soiled that vacuuming or spot-cleaning the carpet no
            longer
            keeps the surface looking good.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Steam extraction forces very hot detergent solution into the carpet and then extracts it
                immediately
                with a suction or wet vacuum.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Carpet cleaning can also be done by spraying a solution onto the carpet and following with suction
                ex-traction. This may be called dry cleaning as there is less moisture in the carpet.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

            <h2>Rugs</h2>
          </header>
          <p>Rugs add softness and warmth, provide positive acoustical properties, and give character and richness
            to
            interiors. A fine rug can be the basis for interior design furnishings and may even be the focal point
            in a
            room. </p>
          <p>Area rugs define an area, such as a conversation area or placement under a dining table, and may
            include
            many of the types of rugs discussed below.</p>

          <h4>Authentic Oriental Rugs</h4>
          <p>Oriental rugs are knotted or tied by hand by native craftspeople from Iran, Turkey, Romania, the
            Caucasus,
            Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Tibet, and China. The fi nest Oriental rugs originated in what was called
            Persia (today primarily Iran) at the height of the rug-weaving era in the fifteenth century.</p>
          <p>An Oriental rug is typically composed of a cotton warp, pile knots of wool or sometimes silk, and a
            cotton
            weft inserted after every two rows of knots. The design and colors are drawn on graph paper and called a
            cartoon. Patterns are symmetrical, often mirroring the design on all four corners. The finer the warp
            and
            knots and the greater the number of knots per square inch, the more intricate the patterns.</p>
          <p>Fine rugs have 400 knots or more per square inch and can take months to weave in a rug-weaving center
            and
            years if the weaver is working alone.</p>

            <figcaption>Turkish Oriental rugs are often an artistic and enduring focal point in contemporary
              interiors,
              as seen here. Oriental rugs hold up well under trafﬁc patterns and can be rotated
              to more evenly distribute the wear. The wool pile of Oriental
              rugs is easy to maintain by regular vacuuming, but when deeply
              soiled, should be professionally cleaned by Oriental rug care
              specialists.</figcaption>

            <h3>Rugs and Carpeting</h3>
          </header>
          <ul>
            <p>Carpeting selected for contract installations varies some-what from that used in residential
              settings,
              where color, price, and durability are the criteria. Contract carpets must meet some or all of the
              following requirements:</p>

            <li>
              <p>Cost must meet budget limitations.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Flammability resistance forms a stringent requirement in many public buildings. Testing for
                flammability is often conducted, and ratings are available to the client through the designer.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Construction is an important criterion. In order for a contract carpet to be durable, minimum
                requirements must be filled for pile density, which means the number of tufts or stitches per square
                inch, together with the distance between rows and the pile height. </p>
              <p>The more dense the tufting or the weave, the stronger the carpet is likely to be. The strength of
                the
                tuft bind, or how tenaciously the face yarn is held onto the primary and secondary backings, is also
                a
                construction criterion. A thin layer of latex, for example, may not prevent the yarn from unraveling
                when pulled.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Weight of the face yarn will be one measure of carpet durability. Heavier face weight will indicate
                the amount of yarn per square measure. Finished pile weight includes the backings as well.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Carpet tiles, typically about 18 inches square, are economical and environmentally friendly in
                contract
                settings. Only the worn tiles (would) need replacing, saving resources. Carpet tiles are tufted
                construction and quite durable.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Abrasion resistance includes the type and quality of fibers and the type, thickness, and twist
                tightness of the yarn, as well as the density.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Resilience means the carpet must have the ability to withstand light, medium, heavy, or extra-heavy
                traffic without undue crushing or matting.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Appearance means the carpet will hide and release soil and will resist staining and fading,
                fuzzing,
                and pilling.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Maintenance is an important factor. Carpets must not show dirt easily. Many contract carpets are
                patterned because they show about 50 percent less wear and soiling than an un-patterned carpet.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Static resistance is important where delicate machinery such as computer terminals may be affected
                or
                where highly flammable materials are present.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Sanitation is a requirement for carpet cleaning and maintenance in clinical and institutional
                facilities.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
