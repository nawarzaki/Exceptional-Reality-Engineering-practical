        <h1>PLANE</h1>
      </header>

      <div>

        <p>A line extended in a direction other than
          its intrinsic direction becomes a plane.
          Conceptually, a plane has length and width,
          but no depth.</p>
        <br>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/form space and order/PLANE/PLANE.png" alt="PLANE" style="height: 20%; width: 38%;">
          <figcaption>PLANE</figcaption>
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>Shape is the primary identifying characteristic
          of a plane. It is determined by the contour of
          the line forming the edges of a plane. Because
          our perception of shape can be distorted by
          perspective foreshortening, we see the true
          shape of a plane only when we view it frontally.</p>
        <br>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/form space and order/PLANE/Shape of a plane.png" alt="Shape of a plane"
            style="height: 20%; width: 38%;">
          <figcaption>Shape of a plane</figcaption>
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>The supplementary properties of a plane—its
          surface color, pattern, and texture—affect its
          visual weight and stability.</p>
        <br>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/form space and order/PLANE/properties of a plane.png" alt="properties of a plane"

          <figcaption>properties of a plane</figcaption>
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>In the composition of a visual construction, a
          plane serves to define the limits or boundaries
          of a volume. If architecture as a visual art
          deals specifically with the formation of three-
          dimensional volumes of mass and space, then
          the plane should be regarded as a key element in
          the vocabulary of architectural design.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/form space and order/PLANE/visual construction.png" alt="PLANE"
            style="height: 20%; width: 38%;">
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>Planes in architecture define three-dimensional
          volumes of mass and space. The properties of each
          plane—size, shape, color, texture —as well as
          their spatial relationship to one another ultimately
          determine the visual attributes of the form they
          define and the qualities of the space they enclose.</p>

        <br>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/form space and order/PLANE/three dimensional volumes.png" alt="three dimensional"
            style="height: 39%; width: 39%;">
        </figure> <br><br>

        <ul>
          <p>In architectural design, we manipulate three generic
            types of planes:</p>
          <li>
            <h4>Overhead Plane</h4>
            <p>The overhead plane can be either the roof plane that
              spans and shelters the interior spaces of a building
              from the climatic elements, or the ceiling plane that
              forms the upper enclosing surface of a room.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Wall Plane</h4>
            <p>The wall plane, because of its vertical orientation, is
              active in our normal field of vision and vital to the
              shaping and enclosure of architectural space.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Base Plane</h4>
            <p>The base plane can be either the ground plane that
              serves as the physical foundation and visual base
              for building forms, or the floor plane that forms the
              lower enclosing surface of a room upon which we
              walk.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <br>



      <div>

        <h2>PLANAR ELEMENTS</h2>

        <p>The ground plane ultimately supports all architectural
          construction. Along with climate and other environmental
          conditions of a site, the topographical character of the ground
          plane influences the form of the building that rises from it. The
          building can merge with the ground plane, rest firmly on it, or be
          elevated above it.</p>

        <p>The ground plane itself can be manipulated as well to establish
          a podium for a building form. It can be elevated to honor a
          sacred or significant place; bermed to define outdoor spaces
          or buffer against undesirable conditions; carved or terraced
          to provide a suitable platform on which to build; or stepped to
          allow changes in elevation to be easily traversed.</p>

        <p>The floor plane is the horizontal element that sustains the force of gravity
          as we move around and place objects for our use on it. It may be a durable
          covering of the ground plane or a more artificial, elevated plane spanning
          the space between its supports. In either case, the texture and density of
          the flooring material influences both the acoustical quality of a space and
          how we feel as we walk across its surface.</p>
        <br>

          <figcaption>office building</figcaption>
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>While the pragmatic, supportive nature of the floor plane limits the extent
          to which it can be manipulated, it is nonetheless an important element
          of architectural design. Its shape, color, and pattern determine to what
          degree it defines spatial boundaries or serves as a unifying element for the
          different parts of a space.</p>
        <p>Like the ground plane, the form of a floor plane can be stepped or terraced
          to break the scale of a space down to human dimensions and create
          platforms for sitting, viewing, or performing. It can be elevated to define
          a sacred or honorific place. It can be rendered as a neutral ground against
          which other elements in a space are seen as figures.</p>

      </div> <br><br>



      <div>

        <h2>wall Plane</h2>

        <p>Exterior wall planes isolate a portion of space to create a controlled
          interior environment. Their construction provides both privacy and
          protection from the climatic elements for the interior spaces of a
          building, while openings within or between their boundaries reestablish a
          connection with the exterior environment. As exterior walls mold interior
          space, they simultaneously shape exterior space and describe the form,
          massing, and image of a building in space.</p>

        <p>As a design element, the plane of an exterior wall can be articulated as the
          front or primary facade of a building. In urban situations, these facades
          serve as walls that define courtyards, streets, and such public gathering
          places as squares and marketplaces.</p>

        <p>A compelling way to use the vertical wall plane is as a supporting element in the
          bearing-wall structural system. When arranged in a parallel series to support
          an overhead floor or roof plane, bearing walls define linear slots of space with
          strong directional qualities. These spaces can be related to one another only by
          interrupting the bearing walls to create perpendicular zones of space.</p>
        <br>

            <p>Interior wall planes govern the size and shape of the internal spaces or rooms
              within a building. Their visual properties, their relationship to one another, and
              the size and distribution of openings within their boundaries determine both
              the quality of the spaces they define and the degree to which adjoining spaces
              relate to one another.</p>

            <p>As a design element, a wall plane can merge with the floor or ceiling plane, or be
              articulated as an element isolated from adjacent planes. It can be treated as a
              passive or receding backdrop for other elements in the space, or it can assert
              itself as a visually active element within a room by virtue of its form, color,
              texture, or material.</p>

            <p>While walls provide privacy for interior spaces and serve as barriers that limit
              our movement, doorways and windows reestablish continuity with neighboring
              spaces and allow the passage of light, heat, and sound. As they increase in size,
              these openings begin to erode the natural sense of enclosure walls provide.
              Views seen through the openings become part of the spatial experience.</p>
          </figcaption>

      </div>

      <div id="ceiling">

        <h2>Ceiling</h2>
        <p>While we walk on a floor and have physical contact with walls, the ceiling plane
          is usually out of our reach and is almost always a purely visual event in a
          space. It may be the underside of an overhead floor or roof plane and express
          the form of its structure as it spans the space between its supports, or it
          may be suspended as the upper enclosing surface of a room or hall.</p>

        <p>As a detached lining, the ceiling plane can symbolize the sky vault or be the
          primary sheltering element that unifies the different parts of a space. It can
          serve as a repository for frescoes and other means of artistic expression or
          be treated simply as a passive or receding surface. It can be raised or lowered
          to alter the scale of a space or to define spatial zones within a room. Its form
          can be manipulated to control the quality of light or sound within a space.</p>

            <p><b>The low sloping roof planes and broad overhangs are characteristic
                of the Prairie School of Architecture. Frank Lloyd Wright.</b></p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>The roof plane is the essential sheltering element that protects
          the interior of a building from the climatic elements. The form
          and geometry of its structure is established by the manner in
          which it spans across space to bear on its supports and slopes to
          shed rain and melting snow. As a design element, the roof plane
          is significant because of the impact it can have on the form and
          silhouette of a building within its setting.</p>

        <p>The roof plane can be hidden from view by the exterior walls of a
          building or merge with the walls to emphasize the volume of the
          building mass. It can be expressed as a single sheltering form that
          encompasses a variety of spaces beneath its canopy, or comprise
          a number of hats that articulate a series of spaces within a single
          building.</p>

        <p>A roof plane can extend outward to form overhangs that shield
          door and window openings from sun or rain, or continue downward
          further still to relate itself more closely to the ground plane. In
          warm climates, it can be elevated to allow cooling breezes to flow
          across and through the interior spaces of a building.</p>

        <p>The overall form of a building can be endowed with a distinctly planar

          vertical and horizontal planes. These planes can be further differentiated
          and accentuated by changes in color, texture, or material.</p>
