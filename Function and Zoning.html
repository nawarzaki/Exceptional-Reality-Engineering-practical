        </header>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Hotels and motels are planned with one or more open-seating areas in the reception area, some
              within
              view of the check-in counter.</p>

        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>In multistory hotels, elevator banks constitute a zone, generally located near stairs or
              escalators.
            </p>
          </li>

        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>A lounge is often a part of the large lobby area, where people wait for friends or relax before
              going
              out to a restaurant for dinner and even where business is conducted.</p>
          </li>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Informal dining, often referred to as a coffee shop, and one or more formal restaurants may be
              located
              on the main level; the nicest restaurants are often on the pent-house level or top floor with a

            <p>In shopping malls, both general large entrances with clear signage and entrances to the anchor

            <p>Open (one- or two-story) central mall spaces with benches and perhaps fountains and other nonretail

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Open food court, where order and pickup counters can be seen from all seating/dining areas. Notice
              that
              the shape, architectural detail, and furnishings of this open space are often interesting—the
              atmosphere
              needs to be emotionally nourishing, even fun.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Department store zones should be clearly marked with graphics or signage so that shoppers can fi nd
              their way in, find what they need, and find their way out.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Smaller shops or boutiques generally have a more open layout, where the entire store may be visible
              from the mall or street entrance. Notice, however, how fixtures and signage separate the merchandise
              into zones.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Merchandise checkout or payment stations should also be obvious, as should important support

        <p>By observing and evaluating the use of the space, we can determine if the space planning was wise and
          well
          thought out or if more research in the design process should have been conducted before floor plans were

      <div id="Trafﬁc_Patterns_in_Contract_Spaces">
        <header>
          <h2>Trafﬁc Patterns in Contract Spaces</h2>
        </header>

        <p>The greater the volume of people or objects, the wider the traffic pattern or corridors will need to
          be.
          This is evident in public architecture such as hospitals and shopping centers, where the traffic is
          heavy
          and corridors are wide. </p>
        <p>Local building codes must be met for corridor widths in contract buildings. Two separate sets of doors
          are
          often employed in contract settings as air-lock entries, or vestibules, to keep out excess cold air,
          rain,
          and snow. This arrangement can also be a security enhancement. The vestibule area should be sizable so
          that
          foot traffic will not pile up and there is room for shelter.</p>

        <p>Traffic patterns in settings such as department or specialty stores can be quite complex, and
          architects
          use visible markers or guideposts to aid the users. People entering contract spaces need to know three
          things in order for traffic to flow smoothly:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>How to get in, </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>How to find their way around, </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>How to get out. Some spaces do this quite effectively. </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>For example, in a well-planned grocery store or supermarket, the buyer is able to find grocery carts
          near
          the entrance, locate items by checking the bright wall signs and the smaller hanging signs over spacious
          aisles, and then find the checkout counter with easy egress to the doors and the street or parking lot.
          Traffic patterns also need to be planned in open, multiuse areas such as the open-plan office. </p>

        <p>Where several functions take place in one area, the furnishings or planning systems can be the
          delineators
          of space. A freestanding wall partition, desk, computer terminal desk, fi ling system, or shelf can be
          moved
          to accommodate changing needs, providing flexibility. Fewer structural walls allow for easier traffic
          flow,
          and the removal of visual obstructions makes spaces seem larger.</p>
