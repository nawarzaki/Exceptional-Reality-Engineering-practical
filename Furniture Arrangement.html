            <h2>Furniture Arrangement</h2>
          </header>

          <p>The placement of furniture and fixtures in an interior is an extension of space planning and is directly
            linked to aesthetics and function. </p>

          <p>Arrangement of furniture ac-cording to aesthetic principles adds to the visual appeal of a space and may
            make its use more satisfying.
          </p>

          <p>But furnishings placed without regard for function and user needs will fall short of intended goals, and
            the aesthetic appeal of the design will vanish as users begin to move furniture around to make the space
            meet their needs. </p>

          <p>A good arrangement of furniture will be both functional and pleasing to the senses.</p>

        </div>

        <div id="Function">
          <header>
            <h3>Function</h3>
          </header>

          <p>Function is the use an environment will have and the activities that will take place there; it dictates the
            selection and the arrangement of furniture. </p>

          <p>For example, a living- room space could be used to accommodate conversation, a library, musical
            instruments, a stereo, a television, video equipment, slides or movies, games, reading, nap-ping, formal or
            informal dining, writing letters, paying bills, growing plants, displaying art, or any combination of these
            or other functions. </p>

          <p>The arrangement of furniture should be planned to accommodate appropriate activities in the amount of space
            available.</p>

            <figcaption>This bedroom space is arranged to accommodate not only sleeping, but also conversation, reading,

        <div id="Combining_Functions">
          <header>
            <h3>Combining Functions</h3>
          </header>
          <p>Often, functions will have a strong relationship to each other.</p>

          <p>For example, the conversation area might also accommodate informal buffet-style
            dining, and the way those two activities interface should be considered. Tables should be arranged close
            enough to seating for easy placement of drinks or plates, and a serving table should be conveniently located
            near the seating area. </p>

          <p>Tables used with seating pieces should be approximately the same height as the arm of the seating piece so
            that food or drink can be reached easily.</p>

          <p>The combination of functions is an absolute necessity in small homes or apartments. Such spaces must often
            include both a dining table and comfortable seating in the same room. Some creative planning not only will
            solve the problem but will create a solution with a great deal of functional and aesthetic appeal. </p>

          <p>One such solution might include moving the sofa to the center of the room. A drop-leaf table could then be
            placed behind the sofa to provide dining space for one or two people. With the table pulled away from the
            sofa or with one leaf extended, even more diners could be accommodated. When not being used for dining, the
            drop-leaf table could double as a sofa table.</p>

            <img src="images/Furniture Arrangement/combined function.png" alt="combined function"

        <div id="Circulation">
          <header>
            <h3>Circulation</h3>
          </header>

          <p>Furniture arrangement needs to accommodate free movement, or circulation, from one space to another.
            Furniture should be placed to enhance that movement by allowing traffic to flow or by restricting and
            redirecting the traffic when necessary. </p>

          <p>This kind of control provides the best utilization of space because it eliminates unnecessary traffic
            patterns. The specific amounts of space necessary for free circulation are addressed in the next section.
          </p>

          <p>These patterns can easily be seen by drawing lines on a floor plan to represent where we would most
            logically walk to get from one space to another—the natural traffic pattern. </p>

          <p>The complexity and lack of organization in the completed pattern usually shows quite clearly the need to
            control traffic.</p>

          <p>We can control the flow of traffic by placing furniture at key locations so that it forces traffic to flow
            away from areas that should be used for seating and conversation or other functions where traffic might be
            disruptive. </p>

          <p>These locations can be determined by preparing a corrected plan indicating where the traffic should flow.
            Laying the corrected plan over the natural traffic plan will show where furniture should be placed to
            control the flow.</p>

          <p>For example, some homes have no entries—the front door opens directly into the living area. In this kind of
            plan, a sofa or other large piece of furniture could be used to divide the seating area from the door area
            and establish a visual entry that directs traffic behind the seating area instead of through it. Such
            placement avoids cutting the room in half with an unnecessary traffic pattern. Thus, a well-placed piece of
            furniture can be a simple deterrent to misdirected traffic.</p>

        <div id="Human_Factors">
          <header>
            <h3>Human Factors</h3>
          </header>

          <p>Anthropometrics, the dimensions of the human form, are an important consideration in arranging furniture
            because human dimensions must be the standard of measure for interior design. One must also consider people
            whose needs for circulation are different from the norm. For example, the needs of those who use
            wheelchairs, canes, crutches, or walkers must be addressed if they are to be able to move freely in an
            interior.</p>

          <h4>Standard Clearances</h4>
          <p> Users without physical impairments require variable amounts of space, or clearance, to circulate
            comfortably within an environment.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Major traffic paths should be 90 cm or wider.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Minimal clearance for traffic is 45 cm.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Seating pieces used with coffee tables need slightly over 30 cm of clearance between the table and the
                front of the seat.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>For a user to be able to extend his or her legs in front of a seating piece, about 90 cm of space is
                required, depending on leg length and the degree of extension.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Desks and pianos require a minimum of 90 cm of clearance for chairs, benches, and users.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Comfortable dining requires slightly more than 60 cm of space per user along the perimeter of the
                table.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>In order to accommodate a seated diner and space behind for passage and serving, 90 cm of space should
                be planned.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Getting in and out of a dining chair requires about 45 cm of space.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>90 cm is considered good clearance between a bed and dresser.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Space between two beds should be from 75 - 90 cm .</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Minimal clearance to facilitate bed making is 45 cm between the bed and the wall.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>In a bathroom, clearance of 75 cm to 105 cm in front of the toilet provides adequate
                space for most functions.</p>
            </li>

            <h3>Proxemics</h3>
          </header>
          <p>Proxemics, a term coined by anthropologist Edward T. Hall, describes the way people use space and the way
            that use is related to culture. Proxemics patterns vary in different cultures; the distances suggested here
            apply to North Americans. Hall's study identifies four distances:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>The space from 45 cm to actual physical contact is considered intimate distance and is
              reserved for displays of affection, comfort, protection, or physical aggression.</li>
            <li>
              <p>Personal distance is equal to the invisible 'bubble' of space with which we separate ourselves from
                others. Everyone has a different perception of this space, and many are made uncomfortable by those with
                smaller bubbles who stand too close and violate personal space. Personal distance usually extends from
                45 cm to 120 cm. </p>

              <p>In many cultures, particularly those of southern Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America, the
                personal-space bubble is much smaller; people are customarily seen appropriately touching and even
                embracing without any threat or discomfort.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The way people normally use furniture is also affected by their perception of personal space; for
                example, few people choose to sit in the center of a sofa. Most people sit at one end, and most often
                they prop one arm on the armrest. </p>

              <p>In this way, a sofa that can comfortably hold three people is most often occupied by only two people,
                since no one wants to sit in the middle. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>A third person sitting on an 245 cm sofa between two people leaves only about 30 cm between each
                person. </p>
              <p>This comes very close to intimate distance, leaving people who are just friends—or, worse yet,
                acquaintances or strangers—in the uncomfortable position of being too close. Furthermore, the middle
                person has no “anchor” in the form of an armrest to cling to for mental protection when that personal
                space is invaded.</p>

              <p>When forced into close contact, we become uncomfortable because we perceive our personal-space bubble
                as a necessary privacy. </p>

              <p>Those who use crowded public transportation or elevators have methods of coping with the unnatural
                intimacy of such situations. Most will become immobile and avoid eye contact. </p>

              <p>Body contact is avoided, and when touching does occur, the tendency is to recoil quickly. Eyes are kept
                focused away from others; to help avoid eye contact, some may keep their eyes fixed on a book or other
                object.</p>

              <p>When strangers enter an empty seating space, they tend to take seats at opposite ends, gradually
                filling the space but leaving a seat between themselves and others. When the only spaces left are next
                to a stranger, some people will choose to stand or will hesitate before taking a seat. Many would
                consider a person aggressive who sits next to them when there are still areas of open seating available.
                Under difficult circumstances, such as when airports are filled with grounded travelers, many of these
                notions of personal space are repressed. </p>

              <p>In such conditions, strangers may be viewed as colleagues in discomfort and the crowding perceived as
                more tolerable.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>From 120 cm to 365 cm is considered social distance. At the far end of that scale interaction tends to
                be more formal, and at the close end interaction is characterized by greater involvement and less
                formality.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Beyond 365 cm is considered public distance. In public distance there is little personal interaction.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>These distances can be helpful in planning interiors. For example, furniture groupings for conversation
                should be planned within the 120- to 365 cm bounds of social distance. Optimal distance for conversation
                is 245 cm—it seems to feel neither too close nor too distant.</p>

            </li>
          </ol>

            <h3>Crowding</h3>
          </header>
          <p>The effects of crowding on animals are well known. In crowded conditions, animals begin to suffer stress,
            abnormal social behavior, illness, and in some cases death. </p>

          <p>Studies of crowding in humans have shown confusing results. Hall cites a study by Frenchman Paul Chombart
            de Lauwe, who discovered that when the subjects of his study had less than 8 to 10 square meters of space
            per person in their residences, their social and physical pathology doubled. </p>

          <p>He also discovered that when the space grew beyond 14 square meters per person, the problems also
            increased, though not as dramatically. Crowding is not strictly a function of dimensions. It also seems to
            be closely related to culture, personality, and the desire for involvement with other people. Those who
            enjoy involvement and interaction with others tolerate and, in some cases, even enjoy crowding. </p>

          <p>They find a crowded, lively environment exciting. Shops, cafés, restaurants, clubs, shopping areas, and
            markets are areas where one might expect to see planned crowding. </p>

          <p>The crowded environment should also provide islands of tranquility for those who enjoy less involvement or
            for those who need to retreat periodically. This type of person may find the effects of crowding (sounds,
            smells, and touch) overstimulating. In home environments, some people enjoy being surrounded by lots of
            furniture, books, and art objects. Others need more visual or actual space in which to mentally expand.
            Designers must be sensitive to these differences in personality and preferences when planning furniture
            arrangements because the amount of furniture and its placement will affect the way users feel about their
            homes.</p>

            <h3>Territoriality</h3>
          </header>

          <p>Territoriality is an aspect of proxemics that deals with the need to have a space of our own. This need
            manifests itself in many ways.</p>

          <p>For example, you may have noticed that many people select a classroom seat at the beginning of a school
            term and sit in the same seat each time the class meets. When someone else sits in that place, they are
            annoyed and feel displaced.</p>

          <p>The same kind of behavior occurs in families where adults and children have determined their places at the
            table or in the car. Variations from the normal seating pattern may lead to conflict. Those who share
            bedrooms may find that certain parts of the room or even a certain side of a bed “belongs” to one person.
            When it is time to clean or straighten the space, things not belonging to one person may end up in a pile
            somewhere in the area that is perceived as the other person's territory. These behaviors are expressions of
            the need to claim space.</p>

          <p>It is important to understand this need so that, when placing furniture, we can not only allocate adequate
            space for each person but also design shared areas with space and amenities that give users the opportunity
            to personalize and establish territoriality.</p>
