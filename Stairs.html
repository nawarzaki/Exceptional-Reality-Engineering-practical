          <h2>Stairs</h2>
        </header>
        <div>
          <p>During the middle Ages, stairs were tucked into tiny turrets (towers) or hidden between walls. In the
            Renaissance the stairway became more imposing, and by the eighteenth century it was often a dramatic focal
            point of the house. </p>

          <ul>
            <p>These same choices govern the design of stairs today. They may be functional and unobtrusive or a very
              dramatic part of the design. Stairs often have some romantic associations, such as sliding down banisters
              or
              hiding on stairways decked with pine boughs to sneak an early peek on Christmas morning. They may conjure
              up
              mental pictures of a grand entry on the night of a first date or of children watching and listening from
              an
              upstairs landing as guests arrive for a party. Stairways can be a beautiful and exciting part of an
              interior. Because the components from which they are assembled may be unfamiliar, they are listed,
              defined,
              and illustrated as follows:</p>

            <li>
              <p>The stringer is the diagonal, notched structural piece that supports and gives form to the stair. On
                the completed stair, the structural stringers are not visible because they are usually covered by the
                treads and risers. On the finished stair, the diagonal molding on the wall next to the steps is also
                called a stringer.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Treads are the flat, horizontal pieces on which the feet step when going up or down a stair.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Nosing is the rounded edge of the tread. The nosing makes the stair less sharp and dangerous. It also
                prevents carpet on the stair from wearing against a sharp edge.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The riser is the vertical member between the treads. It is the riser that acts as a toe kick on the
                staircase. In certain designs the riser is omitted, creating an open-riser stair. Some people feel
                nervous and insecure on open-riser stairs because the stairs may not appear solid.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The starting step is the first step of the stair. It is often bullnosed (with a rounded curve) on the
                open end to support a newel post.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Landings are the intermediate platforms on a stair (often where it turns) or the area at the bottom and
                top of the stair. These are important because they allow the stair to turn and because they make the
                stair safer. People who have difficulty climbing stairs are able to rest on the landing. The landing
                also provides exciting design possibilities—it makes a perfect place for a beautiful window.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The handrail or banister is the piece that follows the pitch of the stair and is held by the hand.
                Easements are the short bends that allow for a change of direction in the handrail. A volute is the
                spiral or scroll end of the handrail that rests on the newel post. Handrails may be the traditional
                carved type, or they can be formed with metal pipes, tubes, flat pieces of wood or metal, or any device
                that is compatible with the design of the stair.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The baluster is the vertical member that supports the handrail. In traditional stairways the balusters
                are usually turned wood. However, they can also be bent metal, square wooden pieces, or panels of glass.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The newel post is a larger baluster that supports or receives the handrail at points of the stair, such
                as the starting step, the landing, and the top of the stair. The design of the newel post can be
                elaborate or simple. The balusters, handrail, and newel posts together make a balustrade, or railing.
              </p>
            </li>

            <ul>
              <p>The stairwell is the open space in which the stair is set. Its shape and size will vary with the design
                of the stair. Stairs may take several different forms. The most com-mon forms are listed here:</p>

              <li>
                <p>A stair whose sides are not attached to any wall is termed an open stair.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>A semi-housed stair is connected to the wall on one side and open on the other.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>A stairway with walls on both sides is called a closed or housed stair.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>A straight stairway without any turns is said to have a straight run.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>A stairway that turns 90 degrees at a landing is a one-turn stair.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>A double-turn stair makes two 90-degree turns at two separate landings.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>A U-stair turns 180 degrees at a single landing.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>A spiral staircase twists around a central axis like a corkscrew. This type of stair takes the least
                  amount of space but is often difficult to negotiate and makes moving furniture difficult.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>A curved staircase may be open or semi-housed and forms a graceful curve.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </ul>

              <h2>VERTICAL CIRCULATION </h2>
            </header>
            <h4>Stairs </h4>
            <p>ADA requires that all steps in a flight of stairs have
              uniform riser and tread dimensions. The minimum
              riser height is 4 inches (102 millimeters) and the
              maximum riser height is 6 inches (152 millimeters).</p>

            <p>The
              minimum depth of a tread is 11 inches (280 millimeters); however, these dimensions should be verified
              with local building codes. ADA does not permit open
              risers. </p>

            <p>A rule of thumb for a well-proportioned stair is that the sum of two
              risers plus one tread should equal
              between 24 and 25 inches (610-35 millimeters). For example: (2) 6" risers + 13" tread = 25" or (2) 152 mm
              risers + 330 mm tread = 634 mm. </p> <br>

            <p>The maximum rise of a ramp cannot exceed 30 inches (762 millimeters) in height without a
              landing. Ramps must have landings at both top and bottom. The maximum slope of a ramp
              is 1:12. A slope that is 1:20 or less is not considered a ramp and does not require handrails.</p>

            <p>Ramp runs that exceed a 6-inch (152-millimeter) vertical drop require handrails on the sides,
              as well as vertical edge protection or a 12-inch (305-millimeter) horizontal surface extension
              beyond the handrails. The minimum clear width of a ramp is 36 inches (914 millimeters). </p>

            <p>Visible, tactile, and audible displays are required at and around elevators to allow

            <p>Audible signals sound once for cars traveling up and twice for cars
              traveling down; for new elevators, they must verbally announce each floor at each stop.
              Tactile designations are required at jambs and should be mounted 60 inches (1 524 millimeters) above
              finished floor. </p>

            <p>Hoistway key access and elevator call buttons must
