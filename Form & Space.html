          <p>Space constantly encompasses our being. Through the volume of space,
            we move, see forms, hear sounds, feel breezes, smell the fragrances of a
            flower garden in bloom. It is a material substance like wood or stone. Yet it
            is an inherently formless vapor.</p>
          <p>
            Its visual form, its dimensions and scale,
            the quality of its light—all of these qualities depend on our perception
            of the spatial boundaries defined by elements of form. As space begins to
            be captured, enclosed, molded, and organized by the elements of mass,
            architecture comes into being.

            <h3>THE UNITY OF OPPOSITES</h3>
            <p>Our visual field normally consists of heterogeneous
              elements that differ in shape, size, color, or orientation. To better comprehend the structure of a
              visual field, we tend to organize its elements into two opposing groups: positive elements, which are
              perceived as figures and negative elements, which provide a background for the figures.</p>

            <figure>
              <img src="images/form space and order/Form & Space/positive elements&negative elements.png"
                alt="positive elements&negative elements" style="height: 15%; width: 48%;">
              <figcaption>
                <p><b>positive elements & negative elements</b></p>
              </figcaption>
            </figure> <br><br><br>

            <p>Our perception and understanding of a composition
              depends on how we interpret the visual interaction
              between the positive and negative elements within
              its field.</p>
            <p>for example, letters are seen
              as dark figures against the white background of the
              paper surface. Consequently, we are able to perceive
              their organization into words, sentences, and
              paragraphs. In the diagrams to the left, the letter
              'a' is seen as a figure not only because we recognize
              it as a letter in our alphabet but also because its
              profile is distinct, its value contrasts with that of
              its background, and its placement isolates it from
              its context.</p>

            <p>As it grows in size relative to its field,
              however, other elements within and around it begin to
              compete for our attention as figures. At times, the
              relationship between figures and their background is
              so ambiguous that we visually switch their identities
              back and forth almost simultaneously.</p>

              <img src="images/form space and order/Form & Space/UNITY OF OPPOSITES 1.png"

              <p>In all cases, however, we should understand that
                figures, the positive elements that attract our
                attention, could not exist without a contrasting
                background. Figures and their background, therefore,
                are more than opposing elements. Together, they form
                an inseparable reality—a unity of opposites—just
                as the elements of form and space together form the
                reality of architecture.</p>

            <p>Architectural form occurs at the juncture between mass and space. In executing and reading design
              drawings,
              we should be concerned with both the form of the mass containing a volume of space as well as the form of
              the
              spatial volume itself.</p>

              and space
              can be inverted in different parts of this map of Rome. In portions of the map, buildings appear to be
              positive forms that
              define street spaces. In other parts of the drawing, urban squares, courtyards, and major spaces within
              important
              public buildings read as positive elements seen against the background of the surrounding building mass.

            <ul>
              <p>The symbiotic relationship of the forms of mass and space in architecture can
                be examined and found to exist at several different scales. At each level, we
                should be concerned not only with the form of a building but also its impact on
                the space around it. </p>
              <p>At an urban scale, we should carefully consider whether
                the role of a building is to continue the existing fabric of a place, form a
                backdrop for other buildings, or define a positive urban space, or whether it
                might be appropriate for it to stand free as a significant object in space.</p>

              <p>At the scale of a building site, there are various strategies for relating the form
                of a building to the space around it. A building can:</p>

              <li>
                <p>form a wall along an edge of its site and begin to define a positive
                  outdoor space</p>

            <p>At the scale of a building, we tend to read the configurations of
              walls as the positive elements of a plan. The white space in between,
              however, should not be seen simply as background for the walls, but
              also as figures in the drawing that have shape and form.</p>

            <p>Even at the scale of a room, articles of furnishings can either stand
              as forms within a field of space or serve to define the form of a
              spatial field.</p>

            <p>The form and enclosure of each space in a building either determines, or is
              determined by, the form of the spaces around it. In the Theater in Seinäjoki by
              Alvar Aalto, for example, we can distinguish several categories of spatial forms
              and analyze how they interact. Each category has an active or passive role in
              defining space.</p>
