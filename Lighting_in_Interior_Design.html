          <p>In lighting an interior, we should strive toward these goals:</p>
          <li>
            <p>To make lighting effective and practical for the activities and purposes of the interior.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>To make the interior more aesthetically pleasing.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>To make the interior psychologically useful.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>To select lighting wisely and use it economically in terms of both product and power.</p>

          <h3>Natural Light</h3>
        </header>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Natural light, or light from the sun, has a full spectrum of colors. Natural light makes colors
              appear
              rich and vibrant and is a healthful, cheerful light necessary for living.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              A balance of natural light evenly distributed from two or more directions is desirable since it
              helps
              reduce shadows in the interior and consequent visual and physical fatigue.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Yet even natural light can lean toward one color, depending on factors such as the time of day,
              season,
              weather conditions, orientation, climate, and location. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The color of light is different at morning, noon, and evening and, within any one of those times,
              will
              vary
              according to the season and weather conditions. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The morning sun in the summer is brighter and warmer than the morning winter sun, and it is more
              brilliant
              and yellow on clear days than on overcast days.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Orientation refers to the direction of the light. For example, southern-exposure light will be
              warmer
              and
              northern light will be cooler. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Orientation also takes into account reflected surfaces. If a northern exposure faces a large orange
              building, then certainly orange will be reflected into the north-facing interior, rendering the
              light
              warmer
              than it would otherwise be.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Light reflecting a deep blue sea or an azure sky will bring bluish light into the interior.</p>
          </li>

          <h3>Natural Light </h3>
        </header>
        <p>Too often in interior practice, the quality of natural light is generally considered, but
          not fully integrated into the design concept. Yet to control, channel, and filter natural light as it
          enters
          a space can be one of the most effective of design strategies.</p>

        <p>Light can be a powerful component of an environment, given our innate tendency
          to react to qualities of light in emotional and intuitive ways: Designers know that
          orchestrating a sequence of spaces to end in a sun-filled room is sure to brighten
          the mood of the occupants.</p>

        <p> in practical terms, studies have shown that
          natural lighting promotes productivity in the workplace and in academic environments. Beyond the poetic
          and
          functional benefits of working with natural light, a
          successful outcome requires its careful manipulation to avoid uncomfortable levels
          of brightness, glare, and heat gain. </p>
        <br><br>

        <h4>ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS </h4>
        <p>To design effectively with natural light, the designer needs to understand the solar orientation
          of each room and the configuration and characteristics of the exterior environment adjacent to
          each space. For example, a room whose windows face south may benefit from a well-placed
          tree that filters sunlight-especially a deciduous tree whose filtering properties change with
          the season. At the same time, a north-facing room may benefit from a wall or landscape
          element that receives strong light from the south that then enters the interior as beautiful
          bounced light. </p>
        <br><br>

        <h4>SOLAR ORIENTATION AND FUNCTION </h4>
        <ul>
          <p>Anticipated activities in a space will determine how natural light should be controlled. </p>
          <li>
            <p>South facing rooms have the best orientation for most functions since they admit the most
              consistent
              sunlight throughout the day.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> north-facing windows allows only
              diffused light to enter, making it an ideal location for an artist's studio. For the same reason,
              a north-facing room is also best for computers since it minimizes the potential for glare on the
              monitor screens.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Window openings that face west receive late afternoon sun at a very low angle, an ideal condition
              for a
              dining room and/or living room, but window treatments will be required to cut down
              on the glare caused by direct sunlight deeply penetrating the space. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>East-facing windows allow
              early morning sun to enter, which is ideal for a breakfast nook or the coffee station in an office
              environment. The orientation of openings in a bedroom should influence the selection of
              window treatments, especially for windows that look east. </p>
          </li>

          <br><br>

          <figure>
            <img src="images/natural light/SOLAR ORIENTATION.png" alt="SOLAR ORIENTATION"
              style="height: 30%; width: 30%;">
            <figcaption>
              <p><b>North: diffuse light <br>
                  West: late afternoon sun <br>
                  East: early morning sun <br>
                  South: most consistent light
                </b></p>
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </ul>

        <br><br>

        <h3>Seasonal Light</h3>

        <ul>
          <p>The altitude of the sun's path is constantly changing and is at its lowest angle in winter and
            its highest in summer.</p>
          <li>
            <p>When the sun is low in the sky in winter, it allows more daylight and
              heat to penetrate a space</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>While the opposite is true in summer. Ideally, a designer should
              observe the changing daylight conditions of a space over the course of a year, paying close
              attention to the amount of light and shade in the morning, at noon, and in the afternoon, as
              the sun changes position in the sky from winter to summer. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The effect of natural light based on the sun's movement can be predicted for any location and time
              of year. </p>
          </li>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/natural light/Seasonal Light.png" alt="Seasonal Light" style="height: 26%; width: 28%;">
            <figcaption>
              <p><b>The angle of the sun is always
                  changing. Its highest angle is
                  reached on 21 June and its lowest angle on 21 December. </b></p>
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </ul> <br><br>

        <h3>CONFIGURING OPENINGS </h3>
        <p>The dimension and configuration of openings in the walls and ceiling will also determine the
          character of natural light in a space. Windows are the most conventional way to channel
          sunlight into a space. </p>

        <p>Their size and configuration can be shaped to create a desired effect.
          In addition to the light passing directly through the glass, bounced light from window sills
          and jambs contribute to the overall level and quality of light in a room. </p>

        <p>The contrast between
          window apertures and their surrounding surfaces must be carefully considered. For instance,
          a south-facing room with a few punched windows in a large expanse of wall will produce an
          unacceptable contrast; the same space with a large expanse of glass, on the other hand, will
          have more evenly distributed light. </p>

        <p>Skylights are another way to channel natural light into a space. It is important to configure the
          ceiling plane and soffits to control the amount of direct sunlight that can penetrate a room,
          since it can lead to unwanted heat gain and can fade rugs, upholstery, and artwork. The best
          top-lit spaces are those that rely on light bouncing from soffits and ceiling coves rather than
          those that allow a direct view of the sky. </p>

        <br><br>

        <h3>CONTROLLING LIGHT </h3>
        <ul>
          <p>Natural light can be controlled in three ways: </p>
          <li>
            <p>Through additive treatments such as blinds,
              curtains, and shades</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>By the specification of the glass</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Through the configuration of the
              opening itself. </p>
          </li>
          <p> New glass technologies such as fritting allow the glazing itself to function as a
            light-filtering system. Coatings for glass can also be specified that filter light entering a space
            and reduce ultraviolet rays in particular. </p>

          <p>The location and the design of the window aperture
            can dramatically affect light quality. Windows that meet the ceiling plane or the wall of the
            room will allow natural light to illuminate an entire surface, enhancing light levels and reducing
            contrast. </p>

          <p>The depth of the wall can also be manipulated by creating deep jambs and sills; an
            outside wall, for example, can be lined with bookcases. Often, the jambs of windows in this
            configuration are canted toward the interior, to maximize the amount of light that reflects deep
            into the room. </p>

          <figure>
            <img src="images/natural light/CONTROLLING LIGHT.png" alt="CONTROLLING LIGHT"
              style="height: 36%; width: 25%;">
            <figcaption>Window treatments are not the only
              solutions for controlling light. When
              views cannot be compromised with
              a window treatment, various glass
              types may be used to filter harmful
              ultraviolet rays. </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <br><br>
          <h3>SYNTHESIZING DESIGN ELEMENTS </h3>
          <ul>
            <p>Designing with natural light requires a careful synthesis with other design elements. Rooms
              that are prone to contrasts of light levels due to orientation and existing window apertures, for
              example, will need to be carefully balanced with artificial light. Color palettes should also be
              coordinated with the quality of natural light in a room.</p>

            <li>
              <p> For rooms that benefit from direct and
                changing natural light, a more neutral palette may be more appropriate. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Rooms that receive
                only northern or diffuse light may warrant more color. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Vernacular architecture indicates such
                an approach: traditional Scandinavian architecture is richly colored, while the traditional
                houses of Greece and Spain are painted white. </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Combustion Lighting</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Firelight, candlelight, and lanterns are other natural sources of lighting called combustion lighting.
          Light from fires and candles flickers, as do lanterns when they are moved about. This inconsistency can
          be
          charming and create coziness. The warmth from a combustion source can also be an asset.
        </p>
        <p> A fireplace draws
          people near it for warmth and comfort as much as for the light. Gas logs flicker—imitative of a real fi
          re
          but without the work and mess. Luminaires (lighting fixtures) may incorporate flame-shaped bulbs that
          flicker to copy the light of real candles.</p>

          <p>Consider a strongly evocative interior space, one where the mood is immediately
            striking, and chances are high that lighting played a central role in its design. In a
            restaurant that is both cozy and contemporary, for instance, artificial lighting will
            inform the design features and the character of the space. </p>

          <p>Simple surfaces and
            colors will have been selected to take best advantage of the light: Walls might be
            a warm, buttery yellow, and mirrors and other reflective surfaces used to throw the
            focal glow of candles and soft light around the room. </p>

          <p>Lighting design that creates a mood is based on an approach that is at odds with
            lighting design that seeks evenly distributed and specific lighting levels. This kind
            of "perfect" all-over task lighting may be appropriate for flexible office space, but it
            fails to produce an imaginative setting for most other human activities. </p>

          <p>By understanding the specific tasks intended for a space, however, the designer can readily
            determine the appropriate lighting strategies that will integrate function and inspiration into a
            design.

            <h4>TYPES OF LIGHTING </h4>
            <p>Artificial lighting is best examined according to the function it performs, typically described
              as ambient, accent, focal, or task lighting.</p>
            <li>
              <p>Ambient lighting is the general-purpose light in a
                space. Ideally, the ambient light source comes from different fixtures that can be individually
                controlled and dimmed depending on the time of day or amount of natural light available. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Accent lighting acts as a spotlight to illuminate a specific artwork, architectural detail, or
                piece
                of furniture. Accent lights are typically low-voltage fixtures that can be manually adjusted to
                focus on a particular object. To avoid glare, the light source should be at a 30-degree angle to
                the object. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Unlike ambient or accent lighting sources, chandeliers, wall scones, and lamps draw the eye
                to themselves. These glowing objects serve as focal points in a room and, in fact, are often
                referred to as focal glow. Most successful lighting design solutions balance ambient light with
                focal glow. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Task lighting provides light for a specific activity. In a typical office space, the light levels
                are
                evenly distributed by a grid of fluorescent fixtures, but are usually supplemented with a task
                light over each desktop. Different tasks require different lighting levels, for which there are
                general recommendations. Lighting levels can be described in foot-candles, which measure
                how much light a lit candle would throw on a surface that is a foot away. The metric equivalent
                is the lux. </p>

        <h3>LIGHTING BASICS </h3>

        <p>Lighting is measured by the amount of luminous flux on a surface, called illuminance. It is
          expressed either in foot-candles (illuminance in a square foot) or in lux (illuminance in a
          square meter). An artificial light source is referred to as a lamp. </p>

        <p>Although lamps are commonly
          identified by their wattage, this does not describe the output of light. A watt is the measurement of
          energy
          consumption from a particular light source. </p>

        <p>So an incandescent lamp and a
          fluorescent lamp can have the same light output of foot-candles or lux, while ranging dramatically in
          wattage. As an example, a 60-watt incandescent lamp has the same light output of a
          15-watt fluorescent lamp. </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Light coming from a single point source can, like direct sunlight, create dark areas of shadow
              around the pool of light it provides. A point source calls attention to the surface it is
              illuminating
              and highlights its inherent characteristics. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Diffuse light, like that on a cloudy day, distributes light evenly and is not strong enough to
              create
              shadows. While this even distribution of
              light may be good in a working environment because it is easy on the eyes, it can seem a bit
              dull and lifeless over time. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>An unshaded lamp or poorly positioned fixture with an exposed lamp can cause extreme
              brightness from a light source called glare. While not measurable, glare is easily recognizable.
              It can impair vision and induce discomfort as the eye usually squints to reduce the impact of
              its harshness. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Veiling reflection is another type of glare that is caused by the brightness of
              a light source reflecting off a shiny surface such as glass. A familiar example might be the
              reflection of a bright window on a computer screen. The well-thought-out distribution and location
              of
              light fixtures can reduce glare significantly. </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div><br><br>

      <div>

        <h3>TYPES OF LAMPS </h3>

        <ul>
          <p>Many types of lamps are available, each with specific characteristics for color rendition, size,
            energy consumption, and lamp life. Juggling all the variables can be complex. To specify
            lamps correctly, designers should know their efficacy rating (1 = low/poor, 5 = high/excellent)
            as well as their correlated color temperature and color rendering index. </p>

          <h3>Lighting Effects in the Interior</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Lighting effects can change the apparent shape, color, and texture of the interior. These effects
          include
          the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>An ambient bank or plane of light is a large, well-lit area. It may encompass the entire interior,
              or
              it
              can designate smaller areas within a large space.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>An even wash is a soft plane of light from spotlights or track lights aimed at a wall or ceiling.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>A light shining at a steep angle or very close to the object or to a surface grazes it with
              luminescence an effective way of emphasizing texture.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>A pool of light is a circle of light thrown by a down-lighter or spotlight. Spotlighting from more
              than
              one direction can balance light and emphasize detail by eliminating shadows.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Perimeter lighting, around the outside of a room or an area, visually expands the space.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Point or pinpoint lighting spotlights a tiny area. Pin-point lighting can emphasize or create
              shiny,
              glittery accents if it strikes a reflective surface.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Line or outline lighting emphasizes a shape or lights an area, such as a dressing table and mirror,
              with
              a line of incandescent lamps or with fluorescent or neon tubes.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Silhouette lighting is accomplished by shining a light directly on an object so that the shadow
              behind
              it echoes its shape.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Lights that shine upward behind objects such as plants and art will “model” the object's shape,
              thereby
              creating patterns on the wall or ceiling.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Lights shining directly downward will cause shadows beneath and around the object. Downward light
              on
              people casts unflattering shadows.</p>

          <h2>Seasonal Affective Disorder</h2>
        </header>

        <p>A form of depression called seasonal affective disorder (SAD), first identified by psychiatrists around
          1980, is a dramatic example of how light can affect the mind and body. </p>

        <p> SAD symptoms include lethargy,
          irritability, and an increased desire to sleep and eat carbohydrates. Because symptoms typically occur
          as
          winter approaches and disappear when spring arrives, experts believe SAD is caused by a disruption of
          the
          circadian entrainment rhythms, the process by which we “set” our biological clocks.</p>

        <ul>

          <header>
            <h3>Manipulating Mood with Interior Lighting</h3>
          </header>
          <p>Factors that determine the physical and emotional effects of lighting include:</p>
          <li>
            <p>Size and source of the lighting</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Direction of the lighting</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Color spectrum of the lighting</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Color and texture of the furnishings being lit</p>
          </li>

        </ul>

        <p>For example, a plane or bank of light minimizes form and bulk, reducing the importance of objects and
          even people. It can fill a person with a sense of space and freedom and can be restful and reassuring.
          This type of general lighting is effective in open areas of public buildings, offices, hotels, and
          retail
          businesses.</p>

        <p> <b> In homes it is often used in kitchens, bathrooms, workrooms, or hobby rooms, where moderately
            bright
            light produces a general feeling of well-being.</b></p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Large areas of bright light stimulate a temporary psychological and physical surge of energy, which
              may
              cause undue fatigue after periods of prolonged exposure.</p>

            <p>The mind will become bored or dulled after a barrage of continuous bright lights. If the light
              becomes
              too brilliant, it can cause malaise, or a feeling of illness. This is one reason why phototherapy
              lights
              for treating SAD should not be installed as general lighting.</p>
            <br>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Moderate to low levels of indirect lighting, accomplished with dimmer switches on ambient lighting,
              are
              sometimes called mood lighting, meaning that the area is inviting, cozy, and intimate. This type of
              lighting is used in restaurants where the clientele come not only for good food but for a relaxed,
              private, and unhurried conversation. </p>

            <p>Mood lighting is favored in homes in formal living or dining rooms, master bed-rooms, family rooms,
              media or theater rooms, and up-scale kitchens and great rooms and as an alternative in computer
              rooms
              and home offices, where low lighting diminishes eyestrain. It helps establish the perimeter of the
              room
              and produces a sense of security. Mood lighting can be accomplished with backlighting (placing
              lights
              behind furnishings) and flickering light emitted from candles, fireplaces, or electric flame lamps.
              Flickering light is usually warm in color, casting a healthy glow.</p> <br>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Colored light also has profound effects on the mind and body. Warm white light and soft, warm
              colored
              light generally are welcoming and up-lifting. However, intensely colored light, such as bright red,
              orange, and yellow, produces consider-able eyestrain. </p>

            <p>This may lead to an eventual feeling of physical exhaustion as the mind struggles to avoid coping
              with
              the intensity. Cool white light and cool-colored lights (blue, cool green, and violet) produce calm,
              restful environments but can eventually become unfriendly, cold, or depressing.</p> <br>

          <li>
            <p>
              Increased energy efficiency via electronic sensors that

              level of natural light, and sensing devices that operate
              lighting in response to radiated heat caused by human
              presence and movement.

        </header>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Use energy-saving fluorescent and LED lighting in place of incandescent lighting where
              aesthetically
              practical. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Open window treatments to allow daylight in.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Bring economical natural light into dark spaces through
              a tunnel skylight with advanced optics to signifi cantly
              improve the way daylight is harnessed. An optional light
              kit can be installed for nighttime artificial light just above
              the diffuser.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Put light only where it is needed, keeping in mind that
              high contrast (a pool of light surrounded by dark) can
              cause fatigue and even distress.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Use dimmer switches for nonfluorescent lamps.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Use light-colored surfaces to reflect and thereby increase
              light, and avoid textures that absorb light.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Use only some of the lights in an interior (use one, rather
              than two, table lamps).</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Illuminate local tasks with portable luminaires with
              fewer lamps or lower wattage rather than general over-
              head lighting.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Use one higher-wattage bulb rather than multiple lower-
              wattage bulbs. For example, one 100-watt bulb uses less
              energy than two 60-watt bulbs.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Install extra light switches so that at each doorway the
              light can be turned off without inconvenience.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Use low-voltage or lower-wattage lamps.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Use motion sensors and photoelectric cells or timers to
              turn outdoor lights on and off automatically.</p>

          <h3>Types of Contract Lighting</h3>
        </header>

        <h4>Natural Daylighting</h4>
        <p>In contract settings such as offices, natural daylight is
          often desired by employees—sometimes even considered
          a luxury. However, problems exist with natural daylighting.
          Temperature control is another major consideration
          linked to daylighting. Excessive heat and cold can result
          from poor insulation or large expanses of glass. Natural
          daylight almost always needs to be supplemented with artificial light; the lighting systems need careful
          control to maintain a healthy balance of light. </p>

        <h4>Fluorescent Lighting</h4>
        <p>Contract interiors are filled with fluorescent lighting. The
          bulk of office lighting, general lighting for public spaces
          such as transportation facilities, retail shops and malls,
          health care, and hospitality interiors are lit with economi-
          cal fluorescent tubes, and for recessed lighting as well as
          table lamps and wall sconces, CFLs are used. </p>

        <h4>LED Lighting</h4>
        <p>LED lighting promises to be a strong contender with fluorescent lighting as energy costs further drive
          the
          search
          for more economical lighting. LED lights, discussed earlier in this chapter, have a host of advantages
          that
          are
          directly applicable to contract spaces. As LED lamps
          become more affordable and offer more appealing color spectrums, their use and applications will
          increase
          proportionately. </p>

        <h4>HID Lighting</h4>
        <p>HID, or high-intensity discharge, lighting is
          used for bright interior and exterior lighting.
          HID lamps establish an arc between two very
          close electrodes set in opposite ends of small,
          sealed, translucent or transparent glass tubes.
          The electric arc generates heat and pressure
          high enough to vaporize the atoms of various
          metallic elements inside the lamp, causing the
          atoms to emit large amounts of visible-range
          electromagnetic energy.
          <br>
          HID lamps are used to “uplight” exteriors
          of large buildings and are being used more
          often in interiors of contract buildings. They
          produce a greater quantity of light using less
          energy than an incandescent lamp. The problems being
          overcome in HID lighting are the noise or hum of the arc
          or ballast and the length of time to restart the lamp after
          a power failure.
        </p>

        <h4>Cold-Cathode Lighting</h4>
        <p>Cold-cathode lighting, or neon lighting, uses different
          gases or vapors to produce colors. Neon lighting has been
          an important part of exterior lighting for advertising and
          storefronts, but it is being increasingly used in interiors
          such as restaurants and retail businesses to emphasize
          a color scheme and add drama and excitement. Lighting
          designers often create unique neon lighting for contract
          interiors.</p>

        <h4>Safety Lighting</h4>

        <p>Safety lighting is required in public spaces where there
          are exit signs, for example. Other safety lighting mandated by building codes includes aisle or entrance
          and
          exit lighting and lighting for stairs and landings. </p>
