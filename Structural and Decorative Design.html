        <h2>Structural and Decorative Design</h2>
      </header>
      <div id="Structural_Design">
        <h2>Structural Design</h2>
        <p>Structural design is seen in any element of interiors where the design is intrinsic to the structure
          and
          the form indicates the function of the piece.</p>
        <br>

        <header>
          <h3>“form follows function”</h3>
        </header>
        <p> The concept of “form follows function” is a credo followed by architects and designers who have
          created
          modern classic works that are simple yet exactingly well thought out and executed. </p>

        <p>To say that form follows function means that the first priority in a design is its function, and the
          parameters of that purpose or function will dictate the shape or form of the design. </p>

        <p>For example, many modern chairs are designed primarily for the comfort and physical support of their
          users.
          The study of ergonomics or ergo fit means that a chair (or even the entire range of furnishings and the
          building itself) is best suited for specific functions that will take place there. </p>

        <p>Structural design has no added decoration, and the design cannot be removed from the structure without
          destroying both the design (form) and the purpose (function) of the piece. In order for structural
          design to
          be considered fine or high-quality design, certain criteria must be met</p>

        <ul id="Structural_design">
          <li>
            <h3>Structural design is unadorned. </h3>
            <p>There will be no carving, decals, unnecessary color changes, or extras of any sort. The design is
              found
              in the form and the materials used—wood grain, for example, or stainless steel or plastic—all
              frankly
              exposed to reveal their real worth.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>The function of the piece must be apparent. </h3>
            <p>For example, a well-designed structural clock will look exactly like a clock and not like anything
              else.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>A structural piece must be well proportioned to be good design. </h3>
            <p>This is particularly true since there is no decoration to cover up the dimensions, the scale, and
              the
              relationship of parts. Much of today's minimalist midcentury furnishings are structural design.</p>
          </li>

        </ul>

      </div>
      <br>

      <div id="Decorative_Design">

        <h3>Decorative Design</h3>
        <p>
          Decorative design is also called “applied” or “ornamentive” design and refers to the ornamentation, or
          embellishment, of the object or structure.
        </p>

        <p>Some subjects are in themselves decorative because of the way they are formed, whereas others may be
          structural pieces with decorative design added. Added decoration can be painted, inlaid, fi red,
          engraved,
          or carved. </p>
        <p>There are four types or categories of decorative design</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Naturalistic design </h4>
            <p>Naturalistic design looks so real we could mistake it for a photo or the real plant, animal, or
              object
              from nature.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Conventional design</h4>
            <p>Conventional design uses designs from nature in a simplified, stylized, or adapted way. The design
              is
              “inspired” by nature but does not copy it accurately.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Geometric design</h4>
            <p>Geometric design is based on geometry: circles, diamonds, squares, and rectilinear shapes and
              patterns.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Abstract design </h4>
            <p>Abstract design is pattern or shape where the source or inspiration is not clear; it could be a
              combination, for example, of conventional and geometric designs. When decorative architecture,
              interior
              architectural detail, or applied design on furnishings is well done, it will have the following
              characteristics:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p> There must be a sympathetic relationship between the style and method of decoration and the
                  object,
                  such as precise etching or engraving of glass or carving or inlaying of wood.</p>
              </li>


              <li>
                <p>The decoration must be suitable for the function and/or style of the piece. If the object is a
                  French Rococo form, for example, then the decoration should not reflect unrelated Victorian
                  motifs.
                  Truly fine decorative design will complement the function. The decoration of a clock face, for
                  example, should not obscure the ability to read the time but should enhance the clock's design
                  richness.</p>
              </li>
              <br>

              <li>The proportion of the decoration must be right for the size of the object. This means two
                things:
                <p> The scale of the decoration should be right for the scale of the object (not too large or too
                  small in proportion).</p>
                <p>The amount of decoration should be in accordance with the size of the object. A piece too
                  heavily
                  ornamented will likely be considered poor design.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The ornamentation should embrace the form and not interfere with its function.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

      </div>
      <br>

      <div>
        <p>Excellent or fine design is impeccable, great design. It is uplifting and visually rewarding, even
          thrilling to aesthetically sensitive people.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Good or fair design is acceptable, though not perfect design. It is adequate for its purpose and is
              generally pleasing.</p>
          </li>


          <li>
            <p>
              Average or mediocre design is bland, uninspiring, un-motivating. Much mass-produced design is
              mediocre.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Poor design is inadequate and disappointing. It is not aesthetically pleasing and usually doesn't
              function
              well either.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Bad design or kitsch is repulsive or silly, unsupportive design. Some items that we label “kitsch,”
              however, are used for humor in the same way cartoons give comic relief. Some kitsch items have
              sentimental
              value.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cost Is Not the Issue</h3>
        <p>Keep in mind that these levels of design have little to do with cost. You can pay just as much or as
          little
          for bad design as for excellent design. The difference will be found in the inherent beauty and
          livability
          that make life more pleasant and rewarding.</p>
