      <h3>Legal Constraints</h3>

      <p>There exists a regulated relationship between the size
        (height and area) of a building and its intended use,
        occupancy load, and type of construction. Understanding
        the projected scale of a building is important because a
        building's size is related to the type of structural system
        required and the materials that may be employed for its
        structure and construction.</p>

        <h2>Zoning Ordinances</h2>
      </header>

      <p>Zoning ordinances constrain the allowable bulk (height and
        area) and shape of a building based on its location in a
        municipality and position on its site, usually by specifying
        various aspects of its size.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>How much of the land can be covered by a building
            structure and the total floor area that may be constructed
            can be expressed as percentages of the lot area.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The maximum width and depth a building may have can
            be expressed as percentages of the dimensions of the
            site.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Zoning ordinances can also specify how tall the building
            structure can be for a particular area in order to provide
            for adequate light, air, and space, and to enhance the
            streetscape and pedestrian environment.</p>
        </li>

        <p>The size and shape of a building are also controlled
          indirectly by specifying the minimum required distances
          from the structure to the property lines of the site in order
          to provide for air, light, solar access, and privacy.</p>

        <li>
          <p>Property lines</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Required front, side, and rear setbacks</p>
        </li>

        </figure> <br><br>

      </ul>

      <p>Building codes specify the fire-resistance ratings of
        materials and construction required for a building,
        depending on its location, use and occupancy, and height
        and area per floor.</p>

      <h2>Building Height and Area</h2>

      <p>In addition to zoning ordinances that may limit the use
        and the overall floor area, height, and bulk of a building,
        building codes, such as the International Building CodeÂ®
        (IBC), limit the maximum height and area per floor of a
        building according to construction type and occupancy
        group, expressing the intrinsic relationship between degree
        of fire resistance, size of a building, and nature of an
        occupancy. </p>

      <p>The larger a building, the greater the number
        of occupants, and the more hazardous the occupancy, the
        more fire-resistant the structure should be. The intent
        is to protect a building from fire and to contain a fire for
        the time required to safely evacuate occupants and for a
        firefighting response to occur. The limitation on size may
        be exceeded if the building is equipped with an automatic
        fire sprinkler system, or if it is divided by fire walls into
        areas not exceeding the size limitation.</p>

        <h2>Maximum Height and Area</h2>
      </header>

      <p>In IBC Table 503, the allowable height and area of a
        building are determined by the intersection of occupancy
        group and construction type. As occupancy is usually
        determined before heights and areas, the table will
        typically be entered by reading down the list of occupancy
        groups to find the occupancy that fits the building design.
        Reading across leads to the allowable heights and building
        areas based on types of construction.</p>

      <p>Note that the distinction between A and B categories
        of construction types is one of level of fire resistance.
        Because category A is of higher fire resistance, Type A
        buildings of any construction type have higher allowable
        heights and areas than Type B buildings. Using the
        principle of classifying occupancies by degree of hazard
        and building types by fire-resistance, the higher the level of
        fire and life safety, the larger and taller a building can be.</p>

      <p>Heights are expressed in two ways. The first is height in
        feet above the grade plane and is generally independent
        of occupancy, but tied to fire-resistance; the second is
        height in stories and is tied to occupancy. Both sets of
        criteria apply to each analysis. This is to avoid having high
        floor-to-floor heights between stories that could generate
        a building exceeding the height limit in feet above grade
        plane if heights were not also tabulated.</p>

        <h2>Types of Construction</h2>
      </header>
      <p>The IBC classifies the construction of a building according
        to the fire resistance of its major elements:</p>

      <ul>
        <h3>Type I </h3>
        <li>
          <p>Type I buildings have their major building elements
            constructed of noncombustible materials, such as
            concrete, masonry, or steel. Some combustible materials
            are allowed if they are ancillary to the primary structure
            of the building.</p>
        </li>

        <h3>Type II </h3>
        <li>
          <p>Type II buildings are similar to Type I buildings except
            for a reduction in the required fire-resistance ratings of
            the major building elements.</p>
        </li>

        <h3>Type III</h3>
        <li>
          <p>Type III buildings have noncombustible exterior walls
            and major interior elements of any material permitted by
            the code.</p>
        </li>

        <h3>Type IV</h3>
        <li>
          <p>Type IV buildings (Heavy Timber, HT) have
            noncombustible exterior walls and major interior
            elements of solid or laminated wood of specified
            minimum sizes and without concealed spaces.</p>
        </li>

        <h3>Type V</h3>
        <li>
          <p>Type V buildings have structural elements, exterior
            walls, and interior walls of any material permitted by
            the code.</p>
        </li>

        <p>Protected construction requires all major building
          elements, except for nonbearing interior walls and
          partitions, to be of one-hour fire-resistive construction.</p>

        <p>Unprotected construction has no requirements for fire-
          resistance except for when the code requires protection
          of exterior walls due their proximity to a property line.</p>
      </ul>

      <p>In planning any structural system, there are two attributes
        that should be built into the design, guide its development,
        and ensure its stability, durability, and efficiency. These
        attributesâredundancy and continuityâapply not to
        a specific material or to an individual type of structural
        member, such as a beam, column, or truss, but rather
        to a building structure viewed as a holistic system of
        interrelated parts.</p>

      <p>The failure of a building structure can result from any
        fracturing, buckling, or plastic deformation that renders
        a structural assembly, element, or joint incapable of
        sustaining the load-carrying function for which it was
        designed. To avoid failure, structural designs typically
        employ a factor of safety, expressed as the ratio of the
        maximum stress that a structural member can withstand
        to the maximum stress allowed for it in the use for which
        it is designed.</p>

      <p>Under normal conditions, any structural element
        experiences elastic deformationâdeflection or torsionâ
        as a force is applied and as it returns to its original shape
        when the force is removed. However, extreme forces, such
        as those generated during an earthquake, can generate
        inelastic deformation in which the element is unable to
        return to its original shape. To resist such extreme forces,
        elements should be constructed of ductile materials.</p>

      <p>Ductility is the property of a material that enables it to
        undergo plastic deformation after being stressed beyond
        the elastic limit and before rupturing. Ductility is a
        desirable property of a structural material, since plastic
        behavior is an indicator of reserve strength and can often
        serve as a visual warning of impending failure. Further, the
        ductility of a structural member allows excessive loads to
        be distributed to other members, or to other parts of the
        same member.</p>

      <br>

      <header>
        <h2>Redundancy</h2>
      </header>

      <p>In addition to using factors of safety and employing ductile
        materials, another method for guarding against structural
        failure is to build redundancy into the structural design.
        A redundant structure includes members, connections, or
        supports not required for a statically determinate structure
        so that if one member, connection, or support fails, others
        exist to provide alternative paths for the transfer of
        forces. In other words, the concept of redundancy involves
        providing multiple load paths whereby forces can bypass a
        point of structural distress or a localized structural failure.</p>

      <p>Redundancy, especially in the lateral-force-resisting
        systems of a structure, is highly desirable in earthquake-
        prone regions. It is also an essential attribute of long-span
        structures in which the failure of a primary truss, arch, or
        girder could lead to a large portion of the structure failing
        or even to its total collapse.</p>

              continuity of the beam across multiple supports results
              in redundant paths for vertical and lateral loads to
              follow to the support foundations.</b></p>

      <p>Extending structural redundancy to an entire structural
        system provides protection against progressive collapse
        of the structure. Progressive collapse can be described as
        the spread of an initial local failure from one structural
        member to another, eventually resulting in the collapse of
        an entire structure or a disproportionately large part of it.
        This is a major concern because progressive collapse can
        result in significant structural damage and loss of life.</p>

          <p>A building frame connected with simple joints is
            subject to progressive collapse if one of its members or
            connections fails. With rigid beam-column connections,
            the same frame possesses ample load paths for both
            vertical and lateral loads.</p>

        <h2>Continuity</h2>
      </header>
      <p>Continuity in a structure provides a direct, uninterrupted
        path for loads through a building's structure, from the roof
        level down to the foundation. Continuous load paths help
        to ensure that all forces to which the structure is subjected
        can be delivered from the point of their application to
        the foundation. All elements and connections along
        a load path must have sufficient strength, stiffness,
        and deformation capability to transfer loads without
        compromising the building structure's ability to perform as
        a unit.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>To prevent progressive collapse, structural members and
            assemblies should be adequately tied together so that
            forces and displacements can be transferred between
            vertical and horizontal elements of the structure. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Strong connections increase the overall strength and
            stiffness of a structure by enabling all of the building
            elements to act together as a unit. Inadequate
            connections represent a weak link in a load path and
            are a common cause of the damage to and collapse of
            buildings during earthquakes.</p>

        <li>
          <p>Rigid, non-structural elements should be isolated
            properly from the main structure to prevent attracting
            loads that can cause damage to the non-structural
            members and, in the process, create unintended load
            paths that can damage structural elements.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Load paths through a building's structure should be as
            direct as possible; offsets should be avoided.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Disrupting the vertical alignment of columns and bearing
            walls on successive floors cause vertical loads to be
            diverted horizontally, inducing large bending stresses
            on the supporting beam, girder, or truss below and
            requiring deeper members.</p>

        <li>
          <p>Lateral forces from the roof are resisted by the diagonal
            braces at the 3rd floor level. The bracing transmits the
            lateral forces to the 3rd floor diaphragm, which in turn
            loads the 2nd floor bracing. Lateral forces collected at
            the 2nd floor are then transmitted through the 2nd floor
            diaphragm to the diagonal bracing at the ground floor
            level. The load path is circuitous because of the vertical
            discontinuity of the diagonal bracing.</p>
