          <h3>Working Drawings or Blueprints</h3>

          <p>The working drawings, sometimes called blueprints, are the sets of plans that specify designs,
            materials,
            and dimensions to guide each subcontractor who works on the home or building. Working drawings include
            the
            following:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Floor plans are drawn to scale (1:50 or 1:100) and show the layout of the rooms
                and their relationship to one another. They are used for estimating cost, for scheduling, and for
                actual
                construction of the building.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Exterior elevations are the exterior views of each side of the building in flat drawings (no
                perspective) showing the finish building materials, the location and style of doors, windows,
                architectural detail, roof, chimney, and other details. Exterior elevations help us judge the
                building
                style aesthetics, or curb appeal.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Schedules indicate how various parts of the building are to be finished. Materials and finishes for
                components such as doors, floors, walls, and ceilings are listed.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Site plans show the situation of the building on the land, legal boundaries, slope, key reference
                points, and possibly information on soils and vegetation. Site plans also indicate details on water,
                sewer, and electrical system grids (hookups).</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Foundation drawings indicate necessary details on footings, fi replace footings, anchor bolts,
                breaks
                in walls, and drains. They are used to estimate labor and materials and to direct foundation work.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Framing plans give projections of the building from the lowest level and up to the roof. They show
                sections, key connections, and the layout of the floors and roof, with necessary information on
                columns,
                beams, and joists. Details are enlarged.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Cross sections are vertical drawings of a slice through the interior of the building, showing the
                relationship and scale of the foundation, walls, beams, rooms, stairs, and other architectural
                elements.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Utility plans show a building's mechanical systems: heating, ventilation, air-conditioning,
                plumbing
                (usually presented separately), electrical, and lighting plans and cable wiring. These plans will
                include layout for other systems such as fi re protection, security, and communications (intercom).
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Interior elevations show types of cabinets and mill-work (molding, railings) and other special
                interior
                features. They are used to obtain bids and construct the items.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Details are enlargements of construction components where clarification or additional information
                is
                needed (for example, custom window arrangement to be framed).</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Specifications are written documents that describe structural or finish materials or custom
                work—what
                is needed, where it is to be located, what quality and craftsmanship level is desired, how it is to
                be
                assembled, and any other special considerations needed for correct construction.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The subcontract is the agreement for specialized work performed by a person or company and
                specified
                for a buildin's construction or finish work. Subcontractors will take information from the
                blueprints,
                determine how much labor and materials are required for their specialty (framing, plumbing, sheet
                roof,
                roofing, electrical, for example), and produce a bid or solid estimate of the job. </p>
            </li>

            <p>The general contractor will usually get three or more bids and select the lowest bid, the
              subcontractor
              with the reputation for the best quality work, or the subcontractor with a reasonable bid and proven
              quality. The interior design package or parts of it, such as carpeting, window treatments, wall
              coverings,
              or furnishings, may also be bid in this manner.</p>
          </ul>

            <h3>Who Will Do the Work</h3>
          </header>

          <p>With blueprints in hand, a commitment must be made as to the actual construction of the new home or
            building remodel. This should not be a quick decision but should be carefully researched and thought
            out.
            Home owners should check references for all professionals they con-sider working with. There are four
            ways
            to accomplish a building project:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <h3>An architect </h3>

              <p>An architect can oversee a building project and will be responsible to hire the general contractor
                and
                insist that every detail be perfect. The architect then becomes the only person the home owner deals
                with, and this arrangement may save a lot of frustration. Architects typically charge a fee based on
                a
                percentage of the finished building costs.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>A home builder, general contractor</h3>
              <p>A home builder, general contractor, or remodeler holds a state-issued general contractor’s license
                and
                hires subcontractors to build each phase of the building, sometimes personally participating in
                parts or
                all of the building process. </p>
              <p>The general contractor will oversee every stage and work directly with subcontractors, the client,
                and
                the building inspectors. Check out credentials and talk to people for whom the builder has completed
                work. Look at the craftsmanship in finished projects, and ask hard questions about the builder’s
                reliability, ease of communication, and customer satisfaction. A contract will be signed, and the
                builder is paid via withdrawals from the lending institution or from your checking account. Never
                pay
                the balance until all the details are satisfied, within reason.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>Hiring subcontractors </h3>
              <p>Hiring subcontractors yourself is an economical option if you have some experience and a basic
                knowledge of the building and remodeling process. Keep in mind that subcontractors (masons,
                carpenters,
                installers, painters, etc.) may be more accustomed to working for a general contractor, for whom
                they
                work regularly; this may make your project less important in terms of quality or reliability. It
                takes a
                certain amount of grit to be your own general contractor. It requires time, effort, and diligence.
                Be
                sure to read up on the topic both before and during the process.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>Do-it-yourself </h3>
              <p>Do-it-yourself is ideal for people with the skills, the tools, the time, the vision, and the
                support of
                family members. Without these, the level of frustration can run high, and keep in mind that fixing a
                botched job often takes more money than the cost of hiring professionals in the first place. DIY
                jobs
                are ideal for smaller remodeling jobs; a person building an entire home alone or with help will need
                many months away from his or her regular employment, or else the job will drag on for an inordinate
                amount of time.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
