              <h1>Material</h1>
              <p>Materials are the essence of the interior designer's palette. They immediately signal
                the designer's vision and inform almost every decision in the process of developing
                an interior.</p>
              <p>Materials have a direct bearing on issues of color, light, texture, and pattern that the designer will
                need
                to address with every project. To make these decisions well, designers must
                learn the myriad qualities inherent in materials, from the
                purely functional to the aesthetic. </p>
              <p>Needless to say, the range of materials available to interior designers is expansive.
                Only those materials essential to an understanding of how to treat the basic components of a room can be
                considered here.</p>
            </div> <br>

            <div id="Wall_and_Ceiling_Materials">

              <div>
                <h3>WALL TREATMENTS </h3>
                <p>Walls define the space of a room or the sequence of movement through an interior. Because
                  they are, in many ways, the primary spatial tool of the designer, their finish is of great importance.
                </p>
              </div> <br>

              <h3>Wall and Ceiling Materials</h3>
              <p>Materials for walls and ceilings come from a variety of sources, both natural and fabricated. Some
                materials used on walls and ceilings can also be used on floors; others are appropriate only for walls
                or
                ceilings. Wall and ceiling materials are hard or rigid, flexible or soft, and their weight varies from
                heavy
                to light.</p>
              <br>

              <ul>
                <header>
                  <h3>Selection Guidelines</h3>
                </header>
                <li>
                  <p>Generally, hard materials echo and reflect or amplify sound;
                    flexible and soft materials absorb sound.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Permanently installed materials initially cost more but may be the least costly in the long run, as
                    they require little finishing, upkeep, or replacement. These include stone, wood, tile, and brick.
                    The
                    time frame of occupancy must also be a factor in selecting permanent materials. A long occupation
                    can
                    justify the costs, whereas frequent moves will not.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Interiors need to be flexible for change. Shifts in the lifestyles of occupants will benefit from
                    flexible materials that can be replaced, such as paint, wall coverings, or fabric.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Pattern on the walls will lock in a style or color scheme and can be restrictive.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Upkeep is a major consideration where there is limited time or budget for cleaning or where traffic
                    or
                    youngsters would tend to soil, mark, or damage the wall surfaces.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Authenticity and style are factors in selecting wall materials. The reproduction of a period room
                    or
                    the general look or feeling or level of formality will largely dictate the actual surface and visual
                    texture as well as the pattern.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>The size of the space can be a determining factor. Heavy textures, large pat-terns, and dark or
                    intense
                    colors close in spaces, making them appear smaller, whereas smooth or subtle textures, small
                    patterns,
                    and light or dull colors visually expand spaces.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>The function of the interior should determine wall material durability. Heavily used areas need
                    impervious materials; little-used areas can accommodate more fragile treatments. High levels of
                    humidity, smoke, fumes, or airborne oils or dirt may dictate non-absorbent materials.</p>
                </li>

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Glass tile requires little upkeep, but cost is high as an imported item. Fiberglass is used in
                      tub
                      surrounds. Upkeep requires nonabrasive cleaners. Mirrors enhance space visually.</p>

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Paint. The least expensive of the wall treatments, but must be applied over a prepared, rigid
                      surface
                      such as Sheetrock or wood. Color range and effects are unlimited, and paint can be reapplied at
                      will.
                      Paint can imitate many materials, such as marble and wood. Professional painting services are
                      costly.
                      Upkeep depends on the use, environment, and type of paint used.</p>
                  </li>

                      type
                      of paint or finish the plaster is given.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Stone. Fieldstone, flagstone, granite, limestone, marble, and travertine. are all heavy, costly
                      materials that are also expensive to install. Structural or decorative effects, but all with
                      natural
                      beauty and little or no upkeep. Lasts indefinitely.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Cultured stone (imitation onyx and marble) is used for tub and shower surrounds and countertops
                      or
                      cabinet tops. Lightweight; moderate cost; requires nonabrasive cleansers.</p>

                  <li>
                    <p>Ceramic, quarry, Mexican, and mosaic tile installations are heavy and costly in terms of material
                      and
                      labor to install. Permanent material, they require little or no upkeep. Tile is also popular in
                      kitchens and bath or hot tub areas as a countertop or cabinet-top material.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Wallboard. Sheetrock, wood paneling, particleboard—all come in sheet form to cover large areas.
                      Sheetrock (plasterboard, drywall) is the most common wall and ceiling material and requires
                      painting
                      or wall coverings. Moderate material and installation cost. Upkeep depends on finish methods and

                      and
                      structural to very decorative patterned effects. Moderate cost of goods, moderate installation
                      costs.
                      Upkeep depends on final layer (fabric, paper, vinyl) and placement and use. In most cases, upkeep
                      is
                      minimal.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Wood and wood moldings, planks, paneling. Wood is costly to purchase but modest to install. Wood
                      has
                      lasting beauty. It can be stained, sealed, or painted. Little or no upkeep.</p>

                <p>Paints are used to add color, durability, and decoration to many elements in an interior, but
                  they are especially appropriate for walls, as they offer a lot of impact for relatively little
                  expense.

              </div>

              <ul>
                <p>Paint is used on walls and ceilings more than any other finish material. The reasons are diverse and
                  all
                  valid:</p>

                <li>
                  <p>Paint is a versatile, inexpensive wall finish and is relatively easy to apply.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Paint offers color and texture variety and ensures protection to the surface.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Painted walls can reinforce interior architecture through neutral, noncompetitive colors.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Paint has contrast and graphic ability, providing visual excitement or drama.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Paint can add richness and subtlety through low-contrast, deep, or soft colors.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Bright-colored paint can accent or draw attention to surfaces and details.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Dark-colored paint reflects little light, thus making the surface seem to advance, and
                    light-colored
                    paints can visually expand spaces.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>The chromatic and textural variety of paint allows it to imitate other materials—wood, marble or
                    other
                    polished stones, tortoiseshell, or fabric, for example.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Trompe l'oeil, painted three-dimensional scenes that fool the eye, adds architectural interest and
                    sometimes humor as scenes of architecture, accessories, or even people that are not really there.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Custom-painted wall or ceiling murals are scenic depictions of mythical faraway places and perhaps
                    in a
                    distant time. They can be very realistic or more suggestive and ethereal; in one location or in
                    various
                    locations indicating a continuing “story” or journey throughout the interior.</p>

                <h3>Stone</h3>
                <p>Description. Natural stone includes flagstone, granite, limestone, marble, and terrazzo, In addition,
                  other general types fit the definition of stone:</p>

                <li>
                  <p>Ashlar refers to a stone that is cut into rectangular shapes so that it can be fitted together into
                    a
                    geometric pattern with grout.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Cobblestone (or river cobbles) are large, rounded, somewhat smooth rocks used to face walls and
                    fireplaces in rustic settings.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Fieldstone is a rugged type of large rocks that may or may not be rounded and smooth. When laid,
                    fieldstone has a random pattern.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Sandstone is a soft, reddish stone that is a type of fieldstone and may be cut into ashlar shape.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Rubble means rough uncut stone or stone that is not uniform.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Artificial stone is made to imitate rubble or ashlar.</p>
                </li>

                <br>
                <ul>
                  <h3>Granite</h3>
                  <p>Description. A very hard crystalline rock with small amounts of feldspar, quartz, and other
                    minerals in
                    crystal or grain form. The size of the crystals varies from very fi ne to fairly coarse. The colors
                    vary
                    from light to dark values and variations of gray, pink, green, brown, and black and may be
                    combinations
                    such as greenish or pinkish gray. May be highly polished or rough cut.</p>
                  <li>
                    <p>Applications. Walls, countertops, fireplace surrounds. Used in both residential and contract
                      settings.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Maintenance. Low upkeep; wipe with a damp cloth. Special considerations. Exact color match will
                      need
                      to
                      be carefully coordinated between the designer and the quarry or supplier. Cost structure. High.

                <ul>
                  <h3>Limestone</h3>
                  <p>Description. A calcite (calcium carbonate) stone with a light-grayish neutralized color. Has little
                    to
                    no pattern and subtle texture, with a typically matte or dull finish. Formed from the calcium
                    carbonate
                    that crystallizes out of a freshwater or saltwater solution and settles via evaporation, leaving a
                    limestone 'mud'; also formed from shells and bones of sea animals, which are broken up by waves into
                    mud.</p>
                  <li>
                    <p>Application. An excellent building stone, as it can be easily carved or cut in any direction
                      without
                      splitting. Because of this, limestone and sandstone are often called freestone. An unpolished,
                      largely
                      ungrained wall material in the form of slabs and tiles. Also used for fi replace surrounds and
                      shaped
                      mantelpieces.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Maintenance. Dust or wipe with clear lukewarm water or mild, nonoily
                      detergent if stone is sealed.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Cost structure. High.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <ul>
                  <h3>Marble</h3>
                  <p>Description. A metamorphic limestone, granular or crystalline, white or colored, often with
                    streaks.
                    The hardest and typically the most expensive of the stones. May be cut into thin sheets or slabs.
                    Can be
                    polished to a high sheen. Cold to the touch. </p>
                  <li>
                    <p>Terrazzo is a composite flooring of broken chips of marble set into cement and polished to a
                      sheen.
                      This is a practical use of marble, since up to 50 percent waste occurs from breakage at the
                      quarry.
                    </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>Applications. Walls, fireplace surrounds, tiles for special or custom installations. Exclusive
                      look
                      for both residential and contract installations.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Maintenance. Clean with warm water and infrequently with soap and water.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Special considerations. The most formal of the stones; rich-looking finish material. </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Cost structure. Very high.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                  <h3>Travertine</h3>
                  <p>Description. A light-colored limestone rock formed near mineral springs. Trapped gas in the stone
                    causes holes and interesting textures that can be filled according to the intended use.</p>
                  <li>
                    <p>Applications. Walls, fireplace surrounds and hearths, bathrooms. Used frequently in contract
                      settings and as accents and for custom installations in residential interiors.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Maintenance. Wash when necessary with clear lukewarm water. Wash no more often than every six
                      months
                      with soap and water and rinse thoroughly. On vertical surfaces it needs little if any cleaning.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Special considerations. Travertine is slightly less formal than marble and widely used.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Cost structure. High.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <ul>
                  <h3>Brick</h3>
                  <p>Description. Clay, shale, and water mixed and shaped into solid or hollow rectangular blocks, etc.,
                    then baked or fired to harden. Brick is colored according to the clay used (red is most typical) or
                    the
                    dyes added before firing. Brick used for constructing walls is typically 18 to 20 cm long by 7.5 to
                    10
                    cm wide and 5 to 7.5 cm thick.</p>
                  <li>
                    <p>Applications. Interior and exterior walls and fireplace surrounds, vaulted or arched ceilings,
                      residential and contract.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Maintenance. Low upkeep—dust or use a mild soap and water solution. Often no upkeep is required.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Special considerations. Can be treated with a sealant such as polyurethane that will prevent the
                      brick from absorbing oil-based spills.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Cost structure. Moderate to high.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul> <br>

                <ul>
                  <h3>Concrete Block and Slab</h3>
                  <p>Description. Large porous bricks made of concrete with air pockets that make the material
                    light-weight
                    enough to handle but also somewhat fragile during handling. Poured slabs of concrete form walls and
                    can
                    be relatively smooth or very rusticated or brutalistic.</p>
                  <li>
                    <p>Applications. Walls, some contract ceilings.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Maintenance. Little or no maintenance. Concrete block surfaces are usually painted and then
                      treated
                      as any porous painted surface. Concrete slabs are rarely painted but are used as a frank and
                      structural building material.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Special considerations. May be used for an exterior building material; then it must be sealed
                      against
                      water permeation.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Cost structure. Low to moderate, although installation or labor to install is high.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul> <br>

                <ul>
                  <h3>Ceramic Tile</h3>
                  <p>Description. Fine, white clays formed into tile shape (bisque), glazed, and fi red at very high
                    temperatures. Finishes vary from shiny and smooth to painted/decal-patterned to rough. Mosaic tiles
                    are
                    very small tiles used to create permanent patterns and pictures on walls. Today mosaic tile comes in
                    preset sheets, a face mount or back mount, ready to be set with grout.</p>
                  <li>
                    <p>Applications. Walls, counters, backsplash areas, ceilings. Used extensively in contract settings
                      because of its durability. Often used in entries, bathrooms, kitchens, and solariums or in any
                      room in
                      warm climates.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Maintenance. Low upkeep. Dust or wipe with clear water, vinegar water, or soap and water for
                      heavy
                      dirt. Grout may soil and discolor. Silicone treatments will make grout less susceptible to soil.
                      Newer
                      developments in grout are more resistant to stains.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Special considerations. Durable surface that maintains good looks indefinitely. Ceramic tile can
                      break, is cold, and is very hard.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Cost structure. Low to high—costs vary considerably in ceramic tiles. Imported tiles from France
                      and
                      Italy can be expensive. Labor to install is also high. However, because it is permanent, the
                      life-cycle cost is low.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul> <br>

                <ul>
                  <h3>Glass Tile</h3>
                  <p>Description. Vitreous glass tiles are thin, square mosaic tesserae. They offer a wide range of
                    colors
                    and are often used to carry out a color scheme. They have a depth of color due to the reflectance of
                    the
                    glass. </p>
                  <li>
                    <p>Application. Durable for walls when luminosity is desirable, especially in bathrooms and
                      kitchens;
                      also suitable for outdoor use. They can add sparkle and shimmer to a space, and are sometimes used
                      as
                      artistic accents within a ceramic or quarry tile application.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Special considerations. Because the surface is flat and even, it will be slippery when wet,
                      limiting
                      use to walls and ceilings in many cases, although glass tile can be used as a flooring material.
                      Even
                      though glass tile is fired at high temperatures, it is still breakable.</p>

                  <h3>Quarry Tile</h3>
                  <p>Description. Made of fine clay and graded shale, with color distributed through the body of the
                    tile.
                    Most is a terra-cotta rust/red, the color of the natural clay. May be glazed but usually left
                    natural.
                    Typical square or hexagonal shapes are most popular.</p>
                  <li>
                    <p>Applications. Walls, counters, backsplashes, ceilings, residential and contract applications,
                      similar
                      to ceramic tile.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Maintenance. Same as for ceramic tile.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Special considerations. Natural terra-cotta color gives quarry tile a timeless appeal.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Cost structure. Tile cost is low to moderate, although installation is costly.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul> <br>

                <ul>
                  <h3>Acoustical Tile</h3>
                  <p>Description. Acoustical ceiling tiles or panels are made from mineral fiber board or from fabric or
                    plastic-clad fiber, fiberglass, and even metal.</p>
                  <li>
                    <p>Applications. Ceilings in primarily contract settings; occasionally for walls.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Maintenance. Maintenance is low. Ceiling installations may show soil around air distribution
                      openings. Follow manufacturer's directions for cleaning. Tiles that become stained are usually
                      replaced or painted.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Special considerations. Acoustical tiles may not be tiles at all but strips of insulative
                      materials.
                      Square, rectangular, and strip materials are usually mounted on a track or grid system, making it
                      relatively easy to install, replace, or access the plenum area above, which houses lighting, HVAC,
                      and
                      other systems.</p>

                <ul>
                  <h3>Architectural Glazing</h3>
                  <p>Description. Transparent or translucent brittle material of molten sand, potash, lime, and perhaps
                    metal oxides for color or for reflecting and screening properties.</p>
                  <li>
                    <p>Applications. Window glazing, curtain wall construction (glass walls over a steel skeleton
                      frame),
                      both residential and contract; interior office walls and dividers; and one-way-visibility windows
                      and
                      dividers.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Maintenance. Transparent glass will show dirt easily and needs occasional maintenance with a
                      glass-cleaning solution. Professional window washers are usually employed for contract
                      installations.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Special considerations. Glass for angled (skylight, greenhouse) installations must be tempered
                      for
                      strength (known as tempered or safety glass). Low-E (low-emission) glass screens out the harmful
                      ultraviolet rays.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Cost structure. Moderate to moderately high.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul> <br>

                <ul>
                  <h3>Glass Block</h3>
                  <p>Description. Transparent or translucent glass pressed and formed as two halves and fused together.
                    The
                    semihollow blocks offer light diffusion and transmission and good insulation. Designs may be
                    imprinted
                    on one or both sides.</p>
                  <li>
                    <p>Applications. Residential and contract applications where light diffusion is needed with some
                      privacy. May also be used in wall and ceiling installations with artificial light behind the
                      blocks.
                    </p>
                    <p>Glass blocks are not for use in loadbearing situations.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Maintenance. Little upkeep. If the blocks become dirty or greasy, soap and water will clean them.
                      Polishing is not necessary.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Special considerations. Variations of glass block include a fibrous glass insert that controls
                      glare,
                      brightness, and excessive heat gain. Solid glass blocks are available for wall installations for
                      greater protection against breakage and forced entry.</p>

                  <h3>Fiberglass</h3>
                  <p>Description. Glass fibers spun or pressed into a lightweight, insulative mass;
                    translucent or opaque.
                  </p>
                  <li>
                    <p>Applications. Wall panels and dividers, bathtub and shower surrounds and units. Fibrous
                      fiberglass
                      “wool” is an insulative material used in wall and ceiling structures. Fiberglass panels are also
                      used
                      for corrugated ceiling panels and patio covers. Both residential and contract applications.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Maintenance. Fiberglass panels and pressed forms are easily scratched and need to be cleaned with
                      a
                      nonabrasive cleanser.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Special considerations. Used where little hard use is anticipated, since it loses its shiny fi
                      nish
                      with abrasion or hard-water deposits.</p>

                <ul>
                  <h3>Mirror</h3>
                  <p>Description. Flawless float glass backed with a coating of silver or silver alloy. May be bronzed,
                    grayed, antiqued (Smokey), veined with gold color, or etched with a design.</p>

                  <li>
                    <p>Applications. Walls and ceilings, residential and contract.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Maintenance. Clean with glass cleaner; polish with soft cloths or paper products.</p>

                  <li>
                    <p>Special considerations. Mirrors will visually expand the space and may be set in place as flat,
                      flawless panels or shaped into patterns such as tile. Mirrors may be used on folding screens or
                      sliding closet doors.</p>

                  <h3>Metal—Aluminum, Brass, Bronze, Copper, Stainless Steel, Tin</h3>
                  <p>Description. An extremely durable material that can be used in several forms. Sheets of aluminum,
                    brass, bronze, copper, and stainless steel may be cut and fitted in place; strips of metal may be
                    installed on clips. Metal panels are available, solid or perforated. Tin panels, with stamped
                    patterns,
                    document Victorian designs.</p>

                  <li>
                    <p>Applications. Walls, ceilings, and custom installations such as wrapped columns. Custom
                      residences
                      and contract installations.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Maintenance. Little upkeep. If surfaces should become spotted from handling, use a metal polish
                      preparation. Painted metals can be washed with soap and water. Follow manufacturer's instructions
                      for
                      cleaning. Most metals are treated to be impervious to oil, dirt, and corrosion.</p>

                  <li>
                    <p>Special considerations. Metals are available in shiny or brushed surfaces. Some metal ceiling
                      systems
                      are designed to be installed over existing ceilings in renovation or remodeling work, making it
                      possible to maintain existing heat and air-conditioning ducts and wiring. </p>

                  <h3>Wallboard</h3>
                  <p>Description. A general category of drywall goods including Sheetrock or drywall (gypsum board—made
                    of
                    crushed and processed gypsum rock). Available in sheets 120 cm by 240 cm or 120 cm by 365 cm and
                    hung
                    with nails or screws to wooden or metal studs. Seams are sealed with paper and covered with plaster
                    mud,
                    smoothed out to be inconspicuous. The wallboard may be textured or left smooth. Smooth wallboard is
                    best
                    for wallpaper installations.</p>

                  <li>
                    <p>Applications. The most common of the wall finish materials for both residential and contract
                      settings. It is a basic material that may be finished as described or overlaid with wall coverings
                      or
                      fabric.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Maintenance. Upkeep will depend on the texture and finish given the wallboard. Paints vary in
                      their
                      ability to withstand repeated cleanings, as do wall coverings and fabric.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Special considerations. Economical wall-covering material. It is also fragile. It will dent and
                      scratch and can be punctured when doorknobs or other hard objects are thrust against it.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Cost structure. Moderate.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul> <br>

                <ul>
                  <h3>Plaster</h3>
                  <p>Description. A paste mixture of lime, sand, and water that hardens as it dries. May be applied as a
                    finish material to be smooth, textured, or rough. Stucco may be a smooth or rough consistency,
                    depending
                    on the fineness of the sand used. Plaster may also be cast into decorative ornaments or cornices,
                    generally called anaglypta or anaglyphs, that can imitate hand carved wood and be nailed or glued in
                    place and painted.</p>

                  <li>
                    <p>Applications. Walls, exterior and interior, ceilings; anaglypta ornament, moldings. Authentic
                      smooth
                      plaster walls are coated over lath (thin strips of wood nailed to the wall studs horizontally,
                      about
                      three-eighths of an inch apart) or over wire mesh. Today, plaster is more often applied over
                      plasterboard or Sheetrock (see wallboard) or concrete block. Plaster is applied as “mud” to seal
                      the
                      perfatape to conceal wallboard seams or applied as rough-textured stucco. It is also sprayed on or
                      hand-applied in a texturizing process and then sanded into the desired texture. A light
                      application of
                      blown plaster is usually called orange peel. Plain plaster applications are more common in
                      contract
                      settings.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Maintenance. Upkeep of plaster depends on the use or abuse, as it can chip, crack, and peel. It
                      scratches and mars easily, and smooth plaster is difficult to touch up with paint. Wash-ability
                      depends on the type of paint used.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Special considerations. Smooth plaster applied over Sheetrock is more costly than sprayed or
                      textured
                      walls. New lath-and-plaster walls are nearly nonexistent because of the labor involved.</p>
                  </li>

                  <h3>Wood: Millwork Traditional Paneling</h3>
                  <p>Description. Stock and custom-milled wood applied to walls and as cabinetry in the form of flat and
                    raised panels, shelving, and moldings. The wood may be hardwood or softwood, plywood or solid wood.
                  </p>

                  <li>
                    <p>Applications. Walls in residential and now, to a substantial extent, in contract work.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Maintenance. Depends on the finish it is given. Oiled or waxed wood may need protection against
                      moisture and will show fingerprints. Millwork is usually sealed with lacquer, acrylic, or
                      urethane,
                      which then is easy to clean with a mild detergent solution.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Special considerations. Installation is considered to be part of the architectural detail and
                      hence a
                      permanent part of the building that is rarely removed unless remodeling takes place. It gives

                  <h3>Wood Paneling</h3>

                  <p>Description. Solid wood paneling comes in thin 120 cm- by 240 cm sheets of hardwoods. More typical,
                    however, is high-quality veneer plywood with a thin layer of hardwood (veneer) laminated to the
                    surface. Hardboard (Masonite) is made of wood fibers compressed under heat or pressure. These may
                    have
                    a veneer or a photo reproduction of wood applied to the surface and grooved to represent a plank
                    wall
                    material. They may also be formed with a surface texture to imitate carved wood panels. </p>

                  <li>
                    <p>Tongue-and-groove strips (milled to interlock) are also used for walls as a paneling.
                      Board-and-batten walls are long strips of wood with narrow strips or lath nailed or screwed over
                      the
                      seams. Bead board has grooves to imitate board and batten.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Wood planks can be installed in a horizontal or vertical direction on walls and ceilings.
                      Scandinavian interiors often feature horizontal wood planks on angled or cathedral ceilings. Wood
                      planks can be butted against each other or installed as tongue-and-groove slats. They offer
                      enhanced
                      insulation; the thicker the plank, the greater the insulation. Log planks are split in half
                      lengthwise
                      so that the flat side is attached to a flat wood-framed wall and the rounded flitch side is the
                      wall
                      material, requiring little or no finishing. Advantages include economy (using half the log), high
                      insulation value, and the ability to run wiring and plumbing in a traditional manner within the
                      wood
                      frame, while the log planks give the look of authentic log cabin walls.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Applications. Walls and ceilings. The quality of the wood will determine the type of residential
                      or
                      contract application. </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Maintenance. This depends on the surface of the product. Paneling may be oiled, waxed, urethaned,
                      or
                      treated with acrylic or other products, or it may have a plastic finish, which varies from a very
                      thin
                      coat to a durable, permanent finish capable of withstanding the wear of any contract installation.
                      Wall-cleaning products are available for wood only, or follow the manufacturer's instructions.
                      Durable
                      finishes may be washed with soap and water.</p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>Special considerations. Wood paneling ranges from a do-it-yourself-project look to an exquisite
                      and
                      costly appearance.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Cost structure. Moderately low to moderately high. Solid wood will be most costly.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul> <br>

                <ul>
                  <h3>Cork</h3>
                  <p>Description. The thick outer layer of the cork oak tree, a broad-leaf evergreen that grows in the
                    Mediterranean region. It is light in color, elastic, and insulative. It is resilient and may be
                    treated
                    with a vinyl coating, making it more durable. It is sound absorbent.</p>

                  <li>
                    <p>Applications. Residential and contract settings where a quiet, resilient surface is required.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Maintenance. Dust or wipe with a damp cloth.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Special considerations. Due to its insulative properties, cork should not be used where solar
                      gain is
                      desired. It will absorb bumps well but can be broken off and is very difficult or impossible to
                      repair. In very thin sheets it may be laminated to paper for wall coverings.</p>

                <h2>Painting Guidelines</h2>
              </header>
              <p>Because paint varies in versatility and ease of application, careful planning and preparation are
                imperative to achieve truly beautiful results.</p>
              <ul>
                <p>Some guide-lines and cautions for using paint include the following:</p>

                <li>
                  <p>Surfaces must be properly prepared. Old paint that is cracked, bubbled, flaked, or peeling must be
                    removed or sanded. Remove wallpaper. Cracks, holes, and damaged areas must be patched and sanded
                    smooth.
                    A clean, dust-free surface will help ensure a flawless finish.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Before selecting paint colors or textures, evaluate the room itself. Look at the dimensions, the
                    moldings, the architectural assets and defects. Evaluate the number of windows, the direction they
                    face,
                    and the amount of light admitted.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Don't try to judge paint color from a small paint chip—the color in large quantities becomes darker
                    and
                    brighter because of quantity. Several paint companies now sell samples of premixed colored paint,
                    available at stores or online. These samples cover a 2- by 2-foot or 4- by 4-foot area to test the
                    color
                    in the room where it will be painted, with the lighting that will affect its appearance.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Trying colors via online painting is another way to judge the effect of paint color, although the
                    actual color may vary according to the computer monitor. The following companies have paint
                    application
                    programs that allow you to try paint colors on surfaces of generic room photos or by uploading a
                    photo
                    of the room you intend to paint:</p>

                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Consider glazing (transparent paints) for unique light-revealing effects and texturizing
                    techniques.
                    Experiment with different color combinations.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Consider orientation and climate when selecting the hue for painted walls. For example, a lively
                    yellow
                    may be warm and comforting in a cool room with a north exposure or in a cooler climate, whereas that
                    same color would visually and psychologically bake the inhabitants of an interior with a broad
                    southern
                    exposure or in a hot climate.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Evaluate what contrast in the paint will do to the room. </p>
                  <p>High-value contrast (very light hues against very dark hues) will accentuate and draw attention to
                    that
                    contrast. </p>
                  <p>This can be dramatically effective where the contrast is in large planes and busy if the contrast
                    is,
                    say, around every door and window. On the other hand, light values next to medium ones or medium
                    values
                    near dark values can provide depth and richness.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Consider the psychological effect of the color. The way people feel about color should be
                    respected.
                    Warm colors are lively and welcoming; cool colors are calm, providing a restful, restrained
                    environment.

                        absorb
                        into the material they are being applied to-usually wood. Stains come in a range of

                        the stain is applied. Stains are unsuitable as finishes alone and need to be
                        varnished to create a durable surface. Varnishes are transparent films and
                        are available in several sheens.</p>

                <p>Terms for paint finishes may vary according to the manufacturer, but in general they fall into the
                  following categories:</p>

                <li>
                  <p>Flat or matte paint reflects very little sheen. It is appropriate for walls and ceilings to give a
                    soft, velvet like texture. Flat paints are the least washable of the lusters. </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Satin or eggshell paint has a small amount of light-reflecting quality, so it hides fingerprints
                    better
                    and is more washable than flat paint. It may be called low sheen or low luster/lustre.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Semi-gloss paint has some sheen to hide marks, is more washable than flat or satin, and contrasts
                    nicely with either flat or gloss paints.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Gloss paint is highly reflective, durable, and easier to clean than lower gloss paints.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>High-gloss paint is the shiniest of the paint lusters and the most durable and scrubbable. Its
                    reflecting qualities, however, will show every flaw on a surface that has not been properly prepared
                    for
                    painting.</p>

                  <p>Texturizing paint comes in various textures. While the majority of the paints used are smooth, some
                    thicker paints are available that can be applied to give the effect of stucco or of suede. These
                    texturizing paints will also absorb more sound.</p>

                <h3>Paint-Texturizing Techniques</h3>
              </header>
              <ol>
                <p>Visual texturizing can be achieved in many ways; just about any effect the design calls for can be
                  accomplished by a skilled painter.</p>

                <p>Smooth textures are achieved by using one of the four common methods of applying paint listed below.
                  These techniques may produce an even surface appropriate in many period settings and modern interiors
                  where woodwork and architectural detail are not important. </p>

                <p>They also make appropriate backgrounds for the broken and textured paint techniques presented in this
                  chart.</p>

                <li>
                  <p>Brush painting is used for corners; small, hard-to-reach areas; and detail work such as window
                    grids
                    and moldings.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Roller painting is very useful for large areas such as walls and ceilings. Small rollers are handy
                    for
                    narrow areas. A different sleeve should be used for each color. Rollers do spatter somewhat, and the
                    roller should never be too full of paint.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Pad painting is useful for smaller areas and will not spatter. Pads cover evenly and are easy to
                    work
                    with.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Spray painting takes on two forms. Airless spraying uses fluid pressure and undiluted paint—it
                    gives a
                    better coverage but uses more paint. Air-compression spray guns use diluted paint and give
                    less-complete
                    coverage. Spraying is common in new buildings, both residential and contract. It is fast and
                    economical.
                    It should be followed with a roller to even out the paint.</p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Antiquing means to make a surface look old, to soften and blur slightly in imitation of the mellow
                    patina that naturally accompanies the aging process. Techniques frequently used in antiquing include
                    color washing, glazing, spattering, and dragging.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Color washing is a technique of applying a coat of thinned, sometimes translucent, paint over a
                    white
                    or colored background. It is versatile, attractive, and easy to use, giving effects from rugged
                    texture
                    (over rough walls) to shimmering translucence (over smooth walls).</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Dragging and combing produce fi ne lines and may be used in wood graining. Dragging or coasting a
                    dry
                    brush over a wet glaze reveals a base color and can imitate fi ne fabric yarns. Combing uses any
                    hard
                    comb like tool. Dragging and combing can be done in straight lines, curving lines, or fan shapes.
                    Cross-hatching by combing can produce a fabric burlap like texture.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Glazing is a technique in which transparent colors are overlayed in sequence, thereby producing
                    various
                    gradations of color.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Marbling is the technique of imitating polished marble stone. If it is done by artisans with a high
                    degree of skill and artistic sense, the marbled surface cannot be distinguished from the real stone.
                    Marbling can also be a mottled whirling, moving flow painted onto the surface.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Outlining means painting contrasting colors or white values on architectural molding.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Picking out means highlighting features on molding, such as dentil trim or carved bas-relief.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Porphyry is a granite like texture achieved by crisscross brushing, then stippling, spattering, and
                    finally cissing (dropping mineral spirits on the splatters to dilute and make shadows of the
                    spatters).
                  </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Ragging and rag rolling partially removes the wet paint or glaze by dabbing with a rag or rolling
                    paint
                    off with a rolled rag.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Shading is the technique of blending color values from light to dark across a wall or ceiling.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Smooshing is a slightly marbled effect achieved by applying a plastic drop cloth to a wall of wet
                    paint, rubbing or “smooshing” the hands over the plastic, and then peeling off the plastic.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Spattering is achieved by filling a brush and flipping the paint onto the base color to produce
                    uneven
                    spots or spatters. </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Sponging (or paint applied with sponges) produces a broken, splotchy effect. Larger sponge pores
                    will
                    produce a more coarse-looking texture and a larger splotch than finer sponges. </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Stippling uses a stippling brush to dab on a colored glaze or paint, revealing some of the base
                    color.
                    The result is finer than sponging.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Wood graining is done by brushing on a glaze and drawing wood grains and lines with an artist's
                    brush.
                    Techniques vary according to the type of wood being imitated. When well done, wood graining can be
                    very
                    beautiful.</p>
                </li>
