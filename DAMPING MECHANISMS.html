        <h1>DAMPING MECHANISMS</h1>
      </header>

      <p>Although stiffening a tall structure to reduce sway and
        limit deflections and deformation under lateral loading,
        large increases in structural size relative to those
        required for strength alone are often required to achieve
        satisfactory dynamic performance.</p>

      <p>A more cost-effective
        approach is to use damping systems that mitigate
        the effects of wind-induced vibration and earthquake
        shaking on tall structures, as well as on its nonstructural
        architectural elements and mechanical components. By
        absorbing and dissipating a significant portion of the
        energy transmitted to the building during high winds or a
        seismic event, damping systems limit excessive motion
        and deflections, moderate structural member sizes, and
        add to occupants' comfort level against sway perception.</p> <br>

      <h2>Active Damping Systems</h2>

      <p>Damping systems that require power for motors, sensors,
        and computer controls are known as active systems; those
        that do not are passive systems. The most significant
        drawback to active damping systems is that external
        power is required to regulate their movement and may
        be undependable during a seismic event when the
        power supply could be disrupted. For this reason, actively
        controlled dampers are more suitable for tall buildings
        subject to wind-induced loading rather than the more
        unpredictable cyclic loading caused by earthquakes.</p>

      <p>Semi-active damping systems combine the features of
        passive and active damping systems. Rather than push on
        a building's structure, they use a controlled resistive force
        to reduce motion. They are fully controllable yet require
        little input power.</p>

        <figcaption>
          <p><b>Tuned mass and tuned liquid dampers,
              located near the top of the building
              structure, act as force generators
              that actively push on the structure to
              counteract a disturbance. They are
              fully controllable and require a great
              deal of power.</b></p>
        </figcaption>
      </figure> <br><br>

      <p>Tuned mass dampers are active systems that consist of a
        large mass of concrete or steel suspended from a cable
        like a pendulum or mounted on tracks in the upper stories
        of a building. When lateral forces produce swaying in
        the building, a computer senses the motion and signals
        a motor to move the weight in an opposing direction to
        minimize or neutralize the motion.</p>

      <p>Tuned mass dampers
        use very carefully determined weights that take into
        account the building's weight, the location of the mass in
        the building, the lag time, and the mode of motion that is
        to be counteracted. Tuned mass dampers are very useful
        in reducing building sway during wind storms but are less
        satisfactory for controlling building deflections during
        seismic events.</p>

      <p>Tuned liquid dampers use water or other liquid in a tank
        designed to give the desired natural frequency of water
        motion. When the building moves under wind loading, the
        water in the tank moves back and forth in the opposing
        direction, transferring its momentum to the building and
        counteracting the effects of the wind vibration. A benefit
        of using a tuned liquid damping system is the availability
        of the water in the tank for firefighting.</p>

      <p>An active tendon damping system uses a computerized
        controller that responds to building movement by actuating
        tension-adjusting members which are connected to an
        array of steel tendons disposed adjacent to the structure's
        main support members. The tension-adjusting members
        apply tensile force to the tendons to counter the force
        causing the deflection of the structure and dampening
        the oscillation of the structure.</p>

      <p>Active pulse systems use
        hydraulic pistons in the foundation or between the stories
        of a building to significantly reduce the lateral forces
        acting on a structure. Both active and tendon systems can
        also be used to counteract the effects of torsion by being
        placed off center in the structure.</p>

        <h2>Passive Damping Systems</h2>
      </header>

      <p>Passive damping systems are incorporated within a
        structure to absorb a portion of the wind-induced or
        seismic energy, reducing the need for primary structural
        elements to dissipate energy. There are a number of
        manufactured dampers available, using a variety of
        materials to obtain different levels of stiffness and
        damping. Some of these include viscoelastic, viscous fluid,
        friction, and metallic-yield dampers.</p>

      <p>Viscoelastic and viscous dampers act as large shock
        absorbers to dissipate energy over a broad range of
        frequencies. They can be designed for integration into
        structural components and connections to control both
        wind and seismic responses in tall buildings.</p>

      <p>Friction dampers dissipate energy only when the slip force
        of two surfaces rubbing against each other is reached and
        exceeded. Metallic-yield dampers dissipate energy through
        the inelastic deformation of the material. Both friction
        and metallic-yield dampers are developed for earthquake
        engineering applications and are unsuitable for mitigating
        wind-induced motion.</p>

        <h2>Aerodynamic Damping</h2>
      </header>

      <p>The wind-induced motion of tall buildings has primarily
        three modes of action: drag (along with the wind), cross-
        wind (transverse to the wind direction), and torsion. Of
        these, cross-wind pressures alternating between the two
        walls of a building parallel to the wind direction, caused
        by vortex shedding, can induce transverse vibrations large
        enough to affect the occupants' comfort.</p>

      <p>Aerodynamic damping refers to how buildings can
        be shaped to affect the airflow around it, modify the
        pressures acting on its surfaces, and mitigate resulting
        motion of the structure. In general, objects having the
        smoothest aerodynamic shape, such as a circular plan
        building, will impede the airflow much less than a
        comparable structure with a rectangular plan, resulting in a
        lessening of the wind effect.</p>

      <p>Because wind-induced forces
        become greater with building elevation, the aerodynamic
        shaping of a high-rise building is one approach which can
        be used to improve its performance against wind loading
        and motion. These modifications include rounded and
        tapered plan sections, setbacks, sculpted tops, modified
        corner geometry, and the addition of openings through the
        building.</p>
