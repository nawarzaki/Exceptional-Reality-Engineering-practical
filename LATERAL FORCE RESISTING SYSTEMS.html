        <h2>LATERAL-FORCE-RESISTING SYSTEMS</h2>
      </header>

      <p>Buildings are three-dimensional structures, not simply
        a collection of two-dimensional planes. Their geometric
        stability relies on a three-dimensional composition of
        horizontal diaphragms and vertical resisting elements
        arranged and interconnected to work together in resisting
        lateral forces assumed to come from any horizontal
        direction. </p>

      <p>For example, as a building shakes during
        an earthquake, the inertial forces generated must be
        transmitted through the structure to the foundation via a
        three-dimensional lateral-force-resisting system.</p>

      <p>Understanding how lateral-force-resisting systems operate
        is important in architectural design because they can
        significantly impact the shape and form of a building.
        Decisions about the type and location of the lateral-
        force-resisting elements to be used directly affect the
        organizational plan of the building and ultimately its final
        appearance.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Roof and floor diaphragms must
            be strong and stiff enough to
            transmit applied lateral forces
            to vertical resisting planes.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Once the roof and floor
            planes have been configured
            to function as diaphragms,
            a minimum requirement for
            stabilizing a structure is the
            arrangement of three vertical
            resisting planes that are
            neither parallel nor concurrent
            at a common point. More than three vertical
            resisting planes is usually
            provided, thus increasing the
            structural stiffness of the
            structure and its ability to resist
            lateral displacements.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p> The lateral resisting planes may be a combination of
            braced frames, moment frames, or shear walls. For
            example, shear walls may resist lateral forces in one
            direction while braced frames serve a similar function
            in another direction. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>In many cases, the vertical-load-
            carrying elements—columns
            and bearing walls—can also
            be integral parts of vertical
            resisting elements.</p>
        </li>

      <p>Lateral-force-resistance in the vertical planes of a building
        may be provided by braced frames, moment frames, or
        shear walls, used singly or in combination. These vertical
        resisting mechanisms, however, are not equivalent in
        terms of stiffness and efficiency. In some cases, only a
        limited portion of a structural frame need be stabilized.</p>

        <li>
          <p>Braced frames use less material and employ simpler
            connections than moment frames.</p>

        <li>
          <p>Lower floor-to-floor heights are possible with braced
            frames than with moment frames.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Braced frames can become an important visual
            component of a building's design. On the other hand,
            braced frames can interfere with access between
            adjacent spaces.</p>

        <h2>Building Configuration</h2>
      </header>

      <p>Building configuration refers to the three-dimensional
        composition of lateral-force-resisting mechanisms
        in a structure. Decisions concerning the location and
        arrangement of these mechanisms—as well as their
        size and shape—can have a significant influence on the
        performance of a structure, especially when subjected to
        seismic forces during an earthquake.</p>


      <div id="Regular_Configurations">
        <header>
          <h2>Regular Configurations</h2>
        </header>

        <p>Building codes base seismic forces on the assumption
          of a regular configuration of resisting systems providing
          a balanced response to an equally balanced distribution
          of lateral forces. In addition, regular configurations are
          generally characterized by symmetrical plans, short
          spans, redundancy, equal floor heights, uniform sections
          and elevations, balanced resistance, maximum torsional
          resistance, and direct load paths.</p>

        <p>Irregular configurations, such as discontinuous diaphragms
          or L- or T-shaped buildings, can develop severe stress
          concentrations and a twisting motion (torsion) that is very
          difficult to resist.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>It should be remembered that vertical
              resisting elements—braced frames,
              moment frames, and shear walls—are
              only effective against lateral forces
              parallel to or in their plane.</p>
          </li>

            <p>A minimum of three vertical resisting
              planes working in conjunction with roof
              and floor diaphragms must be present
              to resist gravity loads and lateral forces
              from two orthogonal directions.</p>

          <li>
            <p>A preferable solution is to have two
              vertical resisting planes parallel to one
              another and a reasonable distance
              apart providing lateral resistance in one
              direction, and another perpendicular pair
              resisting lateral forces in the other. Such
              an arrangement would result in smaller,
              lighter lateral resisting elements.</p>

          <li>
            <p>In the early stages of a design project,
              it is more important to determine the
              three-dimensional pattern of lateral
              resisting elements—and its potential
              impact on the spatial organization and
              formal composition—rather than identify
              the specific types of lateral resisting
              elements to be used.</p>
          </li>

          <p>The arrangement of vertical resisting planes in relation to
            one another is crucial to the ability of a building structure
            to resist lateral loads from multiple directions. Balanced
            and symmetrical layouts of lateral-force-resisting elements
            are always preferable to avoid the torsional effects that
            occur when the centers of building mass and resistance
            are not concurrent.</p>

          <li>
            <p>A pair of shear walls provides lateral resistance in the
              transverse direction but the column-and-beam system is
              incapable of resisting lateral forces in the longitudinal
              direction. Bracing the two column-and-beam frames
              provides the necessary lateral-force resistance.</p>
          </li>

        <p>In larger buildings,
          it is even more critical that lateral resisting elements
          be located strategically to resist lateral loads from any
          horizontal direction and to minimize the potential of
          torsional moments and displacements. For multistory
          buildings with square or rectangular grids, the vertical
          resisting elements are ideally placed in mutually
          perpendicular planes throughout the structure and are
          continuous from floor to floor.</p>

        <p>How the vertical resisting elements are dispersed affects
          the effectiveness of a lateral-force-resisting strategy. The
          more concentrated the lateral resisting elements are in a
          building, the stronger and stiffer they must be. Conversely,
          the more dispersed and balanced the arrangement of
          lateral resisting elements, the less stiff each lateral
          resisting element can be.</p>

        <p>Also critical to the performance of a lateral strategy that
          consists of dispersed resisting elements is the degree
          to which they are tied together by diaphragms so that
          they work in unison rather than individually. In the case
          where the lateral resisting elements are concentrated,
          for example, the horizontal diaphragms must be able to
          transfer lateral forces from the exterior surfaces to these
          internal resisting elements.</p>

        <p>In multistory buildings the service cores housing elevators,
          stairways, and mechanical shafts can be constructed
          with shear walls or braced frames.</p>

        <p>These core walls
          can be viewed as resisting lateral forces from each of
          the planar directions or they can be viewed as forming
          a three-dimensional structural tube able to stabilize and
          stiffen the building structure against lateral loads. Because
          core shafts are normally rectangular or circular in cross
          section, their tubular action offers an efficient means
          for resisting moments and shear from all directions.</p>

        <p>A combination of structural cores and lateral resisting planes
          can offer excellent resistance to lateral forces when placed
          strategically and connected to one another by horizontal
          diaphragms at each floor level.</p>

        <ul>

          <li>
            <p>A single, centered core providing
              all of the lateral resistance for
              a structure would need to be
              stronger and stiffer than twin
              symmetrically placed cores.</p>

          <h2>Irregular Configurations</h2>
        </header>

        <p>It is inconceivable that all buildings will have regular
          configurations. Irregularities in plan and section often
          result from programmatic and contextual requirements,
          concerns, or desires. Unbalanced building layouts,
          however, can impact the stability of the structure under
          lateral loading and especially its susceptibility to damage
          in an earthquake. </p>

        <p>In the context of seismic design,
          irregular configurations vary both in importance and the
          extent to which a particular irregularity exists. When
          irregularities cannot be avoided, the designer should be
          aware of the possible seismic consequences and carefully
          detail the building structure in a way to ensure its proper
          performance.</p>

        <header>
          <h3>Horizontal Irregularities</h3>
        </header>

        <p>Horizontal irregularities include those arising from plan
          configurations, such as torsional irregularity, reentrant
          corners, nonparallel systems, diaphragm discontinuities,
          and out-of-plane offsets.</p>

            <p><b>Horizontal torsion results from a lateral force
                acting on a structure having noncoincident

          <h3>Torsional Irregularity</h3>
        </header>

        <p>Variations in the perimeter strength and stiffness of
          a structure can produce an eccentricity or separation
          between its center of mass (the centroid of the lateral
          force) and its center of rigidity or resistance (the center
          of stiffness of the lateral-force-resisting elements of the
          system). </p>

        <p>The result is a horizontal twisting or torsion of
          the building, which can result in overstressing of structural
          elements and stress concentrations at certain locations,
          most often at reentrant corners. To avoid destructive
          torsional effects, structures should be arranged and
          braced symmetrically with centers of mass and rigidity as
          coincident as possible.</p>

          <figcaption>
            <p><b>Torsional irregularity is considered to exist
                when the maximum story drift at one end of
                a structure is 120% to 140% greater than the
                average of the story drifts at the two ends of
                the structure.</b></p>

        </figure><br><br>

        <p>When a building plan is not symmetrical, the lateral-
          force-resisting system must be adjusted so that its
          center of stiffness or rigidity is proximate to the center of
          mass. If this is not possible, then the structure must be
          designed specifically to counter the torsional effects of the
          asymmetrical layout. An example would be distributing the
          bracing elements with stiffnesses that correspond to the
          distribution of the mass.</p>

        <p>L-, T-, U-, and H-shaped buildings, as well as cruciform
          plan organizations, are problematic because areas of
          large stress concentration can develop at the reentrant
          corners—interior corners where building projections
          are greater than 15% of the plan dimension in a given
          direction.</p>

        <p>These building shapes tend to have differences in rigidity
          among the parts, which tends to produce differential
          motions between different portions of the structure,

        <p>Stress concentrations and torsional effects at reentrant

          <p>There are two basic approaches to dealing with the
            problem of reentrant corners:</p>

          <li>
            <p>The first is to structurally separate the building
              configuration into simpler shapes and connect them
              with seismic joints. The seismic joints are designed and
              constructed to account for the maximum drift of each
              separated unit, accommodating the worst case of the
              two separated parts leaning toward each other. The
              structurally separated parts must each be fully capable
              of resisting vertical and horizontal forces on their own.</p>
          </li>

              levels.</p>

            <p>One possible solution is to tie the two buildings firmly
              together so that the wings will respond better as a unit
              during a seismic event. Collector beams can be used
              at the intersection to transfer forces across the
              intersection core.</p>

          <p>Assuming the wings are tied together, another solution
            is to introduce full-height stiffening elements—shear
            walls, braced frames, or moment frames—at the
            free ends to reduce their displacement and lessen the
            torsional tendency of the building.</p>

        <header>
          <h2>Vertical Irregularities </h2>
        </header>

        <p>Vertical irregularities arise from sectional configurations,
          such as soft stories, weak stories, geometric irregularities,
          in-plane discontinuities, and irregularities in mass or
          weight.</p>

        <h3>Soft Stories</h3>
        <p>Soft stories have a lateral stiffness significantly less than
          that in the story above. A soft story can occur at any level
          but since seismic forces accumulate toward the base, the
          discontinuity in stiffness tends to be greatest between the
          first and second floor of a building. The reduced stiffness
          produces large deformations in the soft-story columns and
          generally results in a shear failure at the beam-column
          connection.</p>

          </figcaption>
        </figure><br><br>

        <h3>Weak Stories</h3>
        <p>Weak stories are caused by the lateral strength of
          one story being significantly less than that in the story
          above. When shear walls do not line up in plan from one
          story to the next, the lateral forces are unable to flow
          directly downward through the walls from the roof to the
          foundation. An altered load path will redirect the lateral
          forces in an attempt to bypass the discontinuity, resulting
          in critical overstresses at locations of discontinuity. The
          discontinuous shear wall condition represents a special
          case of the soft first-story problem.</p>

        <h3>Geometric Irregularities</h3>

        <p>Geometric irregularities are caused by a horizontal
          dimension of the lateral-force-resisting system being
          significantly greater than that of an adjacent story. This
          vertical irregularity can cause the various parts of a
          building to have different and very complex responses.
          Special attention needs to be paid at the points of
          connection where changes in elevation occur.</p>

        <h3>In-Plane Discontinuities</h3>

        <p>In-plane discontinuities create variations in stiffness in
          vertical lateral-force-resisting elements. Variations in
          stiffness should normally increase from the roof down to
          the base of a building. Seismic forces accumulate at each
          successive lower diaphragm level and become critical at
          the second floor level. Any reduction of lateral bracing at
          this level can result in large lateral deformations of the
          first-floor columns and very high shear stresses in the
          shear wall and columns.</p>

        <p>Weight or mass irregularity is caused by the mass of
          a story being significantly heavier than the mass of an
          adjacent story. Similar to the soft-story irregularity, the
          change in stiffness will result in a redistribution of loads
          that may cause stress concentrations at the beam-column

              a seismic event. In response, it will be necessary to
              provide a more substantial vertical lateral-force-resisting
              system to handle the increased load. Either structural

        <p>Occasionally, when the roof or floor sheathing is too light
          or flexible and unable to sustain diaphragm forces, the
          horizontal framework must be designed to incorporate
          bracing similar to that of braced wall frames. In steel-
          framed buildings, particularly industrial or warehouse
          structures with long-span trusses, the roof diaphragm is
          provided by diagonal steel bracing and struts. The most
          important consideration is to provide a complete load path
          from the lateral forces to the vertical resisting elements.</p>

        <ul>

          <li>
            <p>Horizontal bracing, often called wind bracing, depends
              on trussing action and can effectively resist the racking
              of the roof plane, especially for loads coming from

              bracing in all bays of a roof plane. Only enough bays

        <p>Base isolation is a strategy involving the separation or
          isolation of the building from its foundation in such a way
          that it can absorb the shock of an earthquake. As the
          ground moves, the building moves at a lower frequency
          because the isolators dissipate a large part of the shock.
          In this approach, the building structure is decoupled from
          the horizontal components of the earthquake ground
          motion by interposing a layer with low horizontal stiffness
          between the structure and foundation, thereby reducing
          the resulting inertia force the structure must resist.</p>

        <p>Currently, the most commonly used base isolator consists
          of alternating layers of natural rubber or neoprene and
          steel bonded together, with a cylinder of pure lead tightly
          inserted through the middle. The rubber layers allow the
          isolator to easily displace horizontally, reducing the seismic
          loads experienced by the building and its occupants. They
          also act as a spring, returning the building to its original
          position once the shaking has stopped. The vulcanization
          bonding of rubber sheets to thin steel reinforcing plates
          allows the flexibility to occur in the horizontal direction but
          remain very stiff in the vertical direction. Vertical loads are
          transmitted to the structure relatively unchanged.</p>

        <p>Base isolation systems are generally suitable for stiff
          buildings up to about seven stories in height; taller
          buildings would be subject to overturning, which base
          isolation systems cannot mitigate. Recently, however, taller
          buildings have benefited from base isolation. Buildings
          normally require the isolated period to be 2.5 to 3 times
          that of the typical non-isolated building.</p>

      <figcaption>
        <p><b>The effects of gravity and lateral loading apply to all
            structures, no matter what their shape or geometry may
            wish to convey. Even freeform buildings that appear to
            have no regularity to their structure often have relatively
            regular framing systems beneath their surface, or they
            may incorporate a nonrectilinear structural geometry that
            is inherently stable. There are a number of ways one
            can structure nonrectilinear, irregular, organic forms. The
            important issue is that these apparently free forms should
            have an underlying geometric or structural basis, even if
            not apparent to the eye, and that this basis incorporate the
            requisite lateral-force-resisting strategies.</b></p>
