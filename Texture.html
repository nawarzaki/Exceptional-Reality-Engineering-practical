            <h1>Texture </h1>
          </header>
          <p>Incorporating a range and balance of textures in a space can be as character-
            defining as a sophisticated color scheme. It is difficult to think of texture in isolation.
            More effective is to consider it combined with color as part of an integrated concept
            for the design of a room's primary surfaces. </p>

          <p>To work with texture, the designer must
            understand the effects of shadow and reflection caused by the surface configuration
            of materials, including fabrics, metal, stone, wood, glass, and painted plaster. Since
            all of these effects are concerned with how a surface catches light, the integration of
            texture into the design concept further requires the synthesis of material selection
            and lighting design. </p>
        </div>


        <div>
          <h3>TEXTURE IN MATERIALS </h3>
          <p>There are two basic types of textures: visual and tactile. Examples of materials with visual
            texture are wood and stone, their texture defined mostly by the natural graining and veining
            of the material. Tactile textures include hand- or machine-crafted fabrics and carpets. </p>

          <p>These textures are used most effectively when they are positioned adjacent to a contrasting texture.
            A rough texture next to a smooth texture, an opaque material next to a translucent material,
            or a matte surface next to a reflective surface are all strategies that designers should employ
            when thinking about finishes. </p>

        <div>
          <h3>TEXTURE AND COLOR </h3>
          <p>The interactions of color, material, and texture, in turn reacting to light, all contribute to the
            character of an interior environment. More specifically, color value has a direct effect on how
            a material translates its visual or tactile qualities. Three general families of palettes have
            different implications for the role of texture within the overarching design concept: the white,
            neutral, and dark palettes. </p>

          <h4>White Palettes </h4>
          <p>With white color palettes, the shadows created by differences in material textures are more
            pronounced; as a result, this palette strategy often foregrounds texture as the primary design
            concept. A white palette is most successful with an abundance of natural light to highlight
            the contrast in surfaces and textures. </p>

          <p>For instance, the shadows of window shutters can cast
            strong patterns on surfaces that add to the richness of the finishes. This palette can also
            benefit materials with natural textures such as linens and sisal carpets. When paired with
            dark contrasting elements such as an ebonized floor or lacquered surface, a white palette can
            be refreshing and bold, but it demands meticulous maintenance and may not be practical for
            many clients. </p>

        <div>
          <h3>Neutral Palettes</h3>
          <p>Neutral palettes are the least risky from a design standpoint, the easiest to get approved by
            a client, and the most difficult to transform into a sophisticated scheme. A neutral palette
            has fewer associations with a particular era and is therefore unlikely to become dated. On
            the other hand, this approach runs the danger of being banal if a rich range of textures and
            materials is not achieved. </p>

          <p>Neutral palettes can easily incorporate many natural materials such
            as wood, cork, and stone to balance tactile textures with visual textures. When accent colors
            are injected into a neutral palette, they need only be applied in very small areas to create an
            overall compositional balance. </p>

          </figure> <br>
          <p>Neutral palettes cover a large spectrum of color, from creamy to cool gray tones. This range
            needs to be carefully matched with the appropriate natural materials, including wood, stone,
            and metal. </p>
          <p>Creamy tones work well with medium-toned woods such as oak and anigre, warm stones such
            as limestone and travertine, and warm metals such as bronze and copper. Cool gray tones
            work well with dark woods such as walnut and ebony, lighter stones such as arabescato classico or thassos
            marbles, and cool metals such as stainless steel and chrome. </p>

        <div>
          <h3>Dark Palettes</h3>
          <p>In general, darker palettes require more textural contrast than lighter palettes, because shad-
            ows are not as legible. As a result, dark palettes may rely more on reflection than material
            relief for textural contrast. Some reflective materials to consider are polished stone such as
            absolute black granite and black lacquered furnishings. Dark material palettes should include
            lighter contrasting wall surfaces so that the room does not become oppressive or gloomy. </p>

          <h4>Textures and Lighting</h4>
          <p>Both artificial and natural lighting affect the visual quality of textures. Shadows penetrating a
            room can provide visual interest, while reflected surfaces add depth to the overall composition. </p>
