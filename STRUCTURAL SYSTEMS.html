        <h2>STRUCTURAL SYSTEMS</h2>
      </header>

      <p>A system can be defined as an assembly of interrelated or
        interdependent parts forming a more complex and unified
        whole and serving a common purpose. A building can be
        understood to be the physical embodiment of a number of
        systems and subsystems that must necessarily be related,
        coordinated, and integrated with each other as well as
        with the three-dimensional form and spatial organization
        of the building as a whole.</p>

      <p>The structural system of a building, in particular, consists
        of a stable assembly of structural elements designed and
        constructed to support and transmit applied loads safely
        to the ground without exceeding the allowable stresses
        in the members. </p>

      <p>Each of the structural members has a
        unitary character and exhibits a unique behavior under
        an applied load. But before individual structural elements
        and members can be isolated for study and resolution,
        it is important for the designer to understand how the
        structural system accommodates and supports in a holistic
        manner the desired programmatic and contextual forms,
        spaces, and relationships of an architectural scheme.</p>

      <p>Regardless of the size and scale of a building, it comprises
        physical systems of structure and enclosure that define
        and organize its forms and spaces. These elements
        can be further categorized into a substructure and a
        superstructure.</p>

      <br><br>

      <header>
        <h2>Substructure</h2>
      </header>

      <p>The substructure is the lowest division of a building—its
        foundation—constructed partly or wholly below the
        surface of the ground. Its primary function is to support
        and anchor the superstructure above and transmit its loads
        safely into the earth. Because it serves as a critical link
        in the distribution and resolution of building loads, the
        foundation system, while normally hidden from view, must
        be designed to both accommodate the form and layout
        of the superstructure above and respond to the varying
        conditions of soil, rock, and water below.</p>

      <p>The principal loads on a foundation are the combination of
        dead and live loads acting vertically on the superstructure.
        In addition, a foundation system must anchor the
        superstructure against wind-induced sliding, overturning,
        and uplift, withstand the sudden ground movements of
        an earthquake, and resist the pressure imposed by the
        surrounding soil mass and groundwater on basement
        walls. In some cases, a foundation system may also have
        to counter the thrust from arched or tensile structures.</p>

      <ul>
        <h3>An important influence on the type of substructure we
          select, and consequently, the structural pattern we design,
          is the site and context for a building.</h3>

        <li>
          <p>Relation to superstructure: The type and pattern of
            required foundation elements impact, if not dictate,
            the layout of supports for the superstructure. Vertical
            continuity in load transmission should be maintained as
            much as possible for structural efficiency.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Soil type: The integrity of a building structure depends
            ultimately on the stability and strength under loading of
            the soil or rock underlying the foundation. The bearing
            capacity of the underlying soil or rock may therefore
            limit the size of a building or require deep foundations.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Relation to topography: The topographic character
            of a building site has both ecological and structural
            implications and consequences, requiring that any site
            development be sensitive to natural drainage patterns,
            conditions conducive to flooding, erosion, or slides, and
            provisions for habitat protection.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <header>
        <h2>Shallow Foundations</h2>
      </header>

      <ul>
        <p>Shallow or spread foundations are employed when stable
          soil of adequate bearing capacity occurs relatively near
          to the ground surface. They are placed directly below the
          lowest part of a substructure and transfer building loads
          directly to the supporting soil by vertical pressure. Shallow
          foundations can take any of the following geometric forms:</p>

        <li>
          <p>Point: Column footings</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Line: Foundation walls and footings</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Plane: Mat foundations</p>
          <p>thick, heavily reinforced
            concrete slabs that serve as a single monolithic
            footing for a number of columns or an entire building—
            are used when the allowable bearing capacity of
            a foundation soil is low relative to building loads
            and interior column footings become so large that it
            becomes more economical to merge them into a single
            slab. Mat foundations may be stiffened by a grid of ribs,
            beams, or walls.</p>
        </li>

        </figure> <br><br>
      </ul>

      <header>
        <h2>Deep Foundations</h2>
      </header>

      <p>Deep foundations consist of caissons or piles that extend
        down through unsuitable soil to transfer building loads to
        a more appropriate bearing stratum of rock or dense sands
        and gravels well below the superstructure. </p>

      <header>
        <h2>Superstructure</h2>
      </header>
      <p>The superstructure, the vertical extension of a building
        above the foundation, consists of a shell and interior
        structure that defines the form of a building and its spatial
        layout and composition.</p>

      <header>
        <h2>Shell</h2>
      </header>

      <ul>

        <p>The shell or envelope of a building, consisting of the roof,
          exterior walls, windows, and doors, provides protection
          and shelter for the interior spaces of a building.</p>

        <li>
          <p>The roof and exterior walls shelter interior spaces from
            inclement weather and control moisture, heat, and air
            flow through the layering of construction assemblies.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Exterior walls and roofs also dampen noise and provide
            security and privacy for the occupants of a building.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Doors provide physical access.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Windows provide access to light, air, and views.</p>
        </li>

      </ul>

      <header>
        <h2>Structure</h2>
      </header>

      <ul>
        <p>A structural system is required to support the shell of a
          building as well as its interior floors, walls, and partitions,
          and to transfer the applied loads to the substructure.</p>

        <li>
          <p>Columns, beams, and loadbearing walls support floor
            and roof structures.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Floor structures are the flat, level base planes of interior
            space that support our interior activities and furnishings.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Interior structural walls and nonloadbearing partitions
            subdivide the interior of a building into spatial units.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Lateral-force-resisting elements are laid out to provide
            lateral stability.</p>
        </li>

        <h2>Types of Structural Systems</h2>
      </header>

      <ul>

        <p>Given a specific attitude toward the expressive role of
          the structural system and the desired spatial composition,
          appropriate choices for a structural system can be made if
          one understands the formal attributes the various systems
          develop in responding to applied forces and redirecting
          these forces to their foundations.</p>

        <li>
          <p>Bulk-active structures redirect external forces primarily
            through the bulk and continuity of its material, such as
            beams and columns.</p>

          <figure>
            <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/Structural Systems/beams and columns.png"
              alt="ARCHITECTURAL STRUCTURES" style="height: 24%; width: 24%;">
          </figure> <br><br>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Vector-active structures redirect external forces primarily
            through the composition of tension and compression
            members, such as a truss.</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/Structural Systems/truss.jpg" alt="ARCHITECTURAL STRUCTURES"

          </figure> <br><br>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The proportions of structural elements, such as bearing
            walls, floor and roof slabs, vaults and domes, give us
            visual clues to their role in a structural system as well
            as the nature of their material. <br>

            A masonry wall, being
            strong in compression but relatively weak in bending,
            will be thicker than a reinforced concrete wall doing the
            same work. A steel column will be thinner than a wood
            post supporting the same load. A 4-inch reinforced
            concrete slab will span farther than 4-inch wood
            decking.</p>

        <li>
          <p>Surface-active structures redirect external forces

        <li>
          <p>Form-active structures redirect external forces primarily

        </li>

        <li>
          <p>As a structure depends less on the weight and stiffness
            of a material and more on its geometry for stability, as
            in the case of membrane structures and space frames,
            its elements will get thinner and thinner until they lose
            their ability to give a space scale and dimension.</p>

        <h2>Structural Analysis and Design</h2>
      </header>
      <ul>


        <p>Before proceeding to a discussion of structural design,
          it might be useful to distinguish between structural
          design and structural analysis. </p>

        <li>
          <p>Structural analysis is the
            process of determining the ability of a structure or any of
            its constituent members, either existing or assumed, to
            safely carry a given set of loads without material distress
            or excessive deformation, given the arrangement, shape,
            and dimensions of the members, the types of connections
            and supports utilized, and the allowable stresses of the
            materials employed. In other words, structural analysis
            can occur only if given a specific structure and certain load
            conditions.</p>

          <figure>
            <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/Structural Systems/Structural Analysis.jpg"
              alt="ARCHITECTURAL STRUCTURES" style="height: 24%; width: 24%;">
          </figure> <br><br>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Structural design, on the other hand, refers to the process
            of arranging, interconnecting, sizing, and proportioning the
            members of a structural system in order to safely carry
            a given set of loads without exceeding the allowable
            stresses of the materials employed. Structural design,
            similar to other design activities, must operate in an
            environment of uncertainty, ambiguity, and approximation.
            It is a search for a structural system that can meet not only

            urban design, and programmatic issues at hand.</p>

        <p>The first step in the structural design process may be
          stimulated by the nature of the architectural design, its site
          and context, or the availability of certain materials.</p>

        <li>
          <p>The architectural design idea may elicit a specific type
            of configuration or pattern.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The site and context may suggest a certain type of
            structural response.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Structural materials may be dictated by building code3
            requirements, supply, availability of labor, or costs.</p>

      </header>

      <p>The manner in which forces are transferred from one
        structural element to the next and how a structural
        system performs as a whole depend to a great extent
        on the types of joints and connections used. Structural
        elements can be joined to each other in three ways.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Butt joints allow one of the elements to be continuous
            and usually require a third mediating element to make
            the connection.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Overlapping joints allow all of the connected elements
            to bypass each other and be continuous across the
            joint.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The joining elements can also be molded or shaped to
            form a structural connection.</p>
        </li>

      </ul>

      <ul>
        <p>We can also categorize structural connections on a
          geometric basis.</p>

        <li>
          <p>Point: bolted connections</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Line: welded connections</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Plane: glued connections</p>
        </li>

        </figure> <br><br>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <p>There are four fundamental types of structural
          connections.</p>

        <li>
          <p>Pin or hinge joints allow rotation but resist translation
            in any direction.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Roller joints or supports allow rotation but resist
            translation in a direction perpendicular into or away
            from its face.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Rigid or fixed joints maintain the angular relationship
            between the joined elements, restrain rotation and
            translation in any direction, and provide both force and
            moment resistance.</p>
        </li>

        </figure> <br><br>

        <li>
          <p>Cable supports or anchorages allow rotation but resist
            translation only in the direction of the cable.</p>
        </li>

        <p>In the design process, we tend to think first of the larger
          holistic pattern before we consider the elemental structural
          units that make up the larger whole. So as we strategize
          to develop a structural plan for a building, we should
          consider both the essential qualities of the architectural
          composition and the nature and configuration of the
          structural elements. This leads to a series of fundamental
          questions:</p>

        <h3>Building Design</h3>
        <li>
          <p>Is there an overarching form required or does the
            architectural composition consist of articulated parts? If
            so, are these parts to be hierarchically ordered?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Are the principal architectural elements planar or linear
            in nature?</p>
        </li>

            alt="ARCHITECTURAL STRUCTURES" style="height: 24%; width: 36%;">
        </figure> <br><br>

        <h3>Building Program</h3>
        <li>
          <p>Are there required relationships between the desirable
            scale and proportion of the program spaces, the
            spanning capability of the structural system, and the
            resulting layout and spacing of supports?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Is there a compelling spatial reason for one-way or two-
            way spanning systems?</p>
        </li>

        <figure>

            alt="ARCHITECTURAL STRUCTURES" style="height: 24%; width: 36%;">
        </figure> <br><br>

        <h3>Systems Integration</h3>
        <li>
          <p>How might the mechanical and other building systems
            be integrated with the structural system?</p>
        </li>

        <h3>Code Requirements</h3>
        <li>
          <p>What are the building code requirements for the
            intended use, occupancy, and scale of building?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>What is the type of construction and what are the
            structural materials required?</p>
        </li>

        <figure>

            alt="ARCHITECTURAL STRUCTURES" style="height: 24%; width: 36%;">
        </figure> <br><br>


        <h3>Economic Feasibility</h3>
        <li>
          <p>How might material availability, fabrication processes,
            transportation requirements, labor and equipment
            requirements, and erection time influence the choice of
            a structural system?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Is there a need to allow for expansion and growth either
            horizontally or vertically?</p>
        </li>
