      <div id="LIGHT">
        <p>"Architecture is the masterly, correct and magnificent play of masses brought
          together in light. Our eyes are made to see forms in light; light and shade reveal
          these formsâ€¦" <br>
          Le Corbusier: Towards a New Architecture</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/form space and order/LIGHT/Ronchamp.jpg" alt="LIGHT" style="height: 24%; width: 60%;">

        <p>The sun is the rich source of natural light for the illumination of
          forms and spaces in architecture. While the sun's radiation is
          intense, the quality of its light, manifested in the form of direct
          sunlight or diffuse daylight, varies with the time of day, from
          season to season, and from place to place. As the luminous
          energy of the sun is dispersed by clouds, haze, and precipitation,
          it transmits the changing colors of the sky and the weather to
          the forms and surfaces it illuminates.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/form space and order/LIGHT/light.png" alt="LIGHT" style="height: 24%; width: 48%;">
          <figcaption>
            <p><b>Light</b></p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure> <br><br>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/form space and order/LIGHT/Fallingwater (Kaufmann House).png" alt="LIGHT"
            style="height: 24%; width: 75%;">
          <figcaption>

        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>Penetrating a space through windows in a wall plane, or
          through skylights in the overhead roof plane, the radiant
          energy of the sun falls upon the surfaces within the room,
          enlivens their colors, and reveals their textures. With the
          shifting patterns of light, shade, and shadows that it creates,
          the sun animates the space of the room, and articulates the
          forms within it. By its intensity and dispersion within the
          room, the luminous energy of the sun can clarify the form of
          the space or distort it. The color and brilliance of sunlight can
          create a festive atmosphere within the room or a more diffuse
          daylight can instill within it a somber mood.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/form space and order/LIGHT/Sun_Path.png" alt="LIGHT" style="height: 24%; width: 48%;">
          <figcaption>
            <p><b>Sun_Path Diagram for the Northern Hemisphere</b></p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>Since the intensity and direction of the light the sun radiates
          is fairly predictable, its visual impact on the surfaces, forms,
          and space of a room can be predicated on the size, location,
          and orientation of windows and skylights within the enclosure.</p>

        <p>The size of a window or skylight controls the amount
          of daylight a room receives. The size of an opening
          in a wall or roof plane, however, is also regulated
          by factors other than light, such as the materials
          and construction of the wall or roof plane; code
          requirements for ventilation; the desire for views and
          visual privacy; the appropriate degree of enclosure for
          the space; and the effect of openings on the exterior
          form of a building. The location and orientation of a
          window or skylight, therefore, can be more important
          than its size in determining the quality of daylight a
          room receives.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/form space and order/LIGHT/size of a window or skylight.png" alt="LIGHT"
            style="height: 24%; width: 48%;">
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>An opening can be oriented to receive direct sunlight
          during certain portions of the day. Direct sunlight
          provides a high degree of illumination that is especially
          intense during midday hours. It creates sharp
          patterns of light and dark on the surfaces of a room
          and crisply articulates the forms within the space.
          Possible detrimental effects of direct sunlight, such
          as glare and excessive heat gain, can be controlled by
          shading devices built into the form of the opening or
          provided by the foliage of nearby trees or adjacent
          structures.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/form space and order/LIGHT/opening orientation.png" alt="LIGHT"
            style="height: 24%; width: 48%;">
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>An opening can also be oriented away from direct
          sunlight and receive instead the diffuse, ambient
          light from the sky vault overhead. The sky vault is a
          beneficial source of daylight since it remains fairly
          constant, even on cloudy days, and can help to soften
          the harshness of direct sunlight and balance the light
          level within a space.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/form space and order/LIGHT/opening orientation 2.png" alt="LIGHT"
            style="height: 24%; width: 48%;">
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>The location of an opening affects the manner in
          which natural light enters a room and illuminates its
          forms and surfaces. When located entirely within a
          wall plane, an opening can appear as a bright spot of
          light on a darker surface. This condition can induce
          glare if an excessive degree of contrast exists
          between the brightness of the opening and the
          darker surface surrounding it. The uncomfortable
          or debilitating glare caused by excessive brightness
          ratios between adjacent surfaces or areas in a room
          can be ameliorated by allowing daylight to enter the
          space from at least two directions.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/form space and order/LIGHT/location of an opening.png" alt="LIGHT"
            style="height: 24%; width: 48%;">
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>When an opening is located along the edge of a wall
          or at the corner of a room, the daylight entering
          through it will wash the surface of the wall adjacent
          and perpendicular to the plane of the opening. This
          illuminated surface itself becomes a source of light
          and enhances the light level within the space.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/form space and order/LIGHT/location of an opening 1.png" alt="LIGHT"
            style="height: 24%; width: 48%;">
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>Additional factors influence the quality of light
          within a room. The shape and articulation of an
          opening is reflected in the shadow pattern cast by
          sunlight on the forms and surfaces of the room. The
          color and texture of these forms and surfaces, in
          turn, affect their reflectivity and the ambient light
          level within the space.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/form space and order/LIGHT/shape and articulation of an opening.png" alt="LIGHT"
            style="height: 24%; width: 48%;">
        </figure> <br><br>
