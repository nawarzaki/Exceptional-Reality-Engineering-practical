        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <p>Architecture is generally conceived—designed—realized—built—in response to an existing set of conditions.
          These conditions may be purely functional in nature, or they may also reflect in varying degrees the
          social,
          political, and economic climate. In any case, it is assumed that the existing set of conditions—the
          problem—is less than satisfactory and that a new set of conditions—a solution—would be desirable. The act
          of
          creating architecture, then, is a problem-solving or design process.</p>

        <p>The initial phase of any design process is the recognition of a problematic condition and the decision to
          find a solution to it. Design is above all a willful act, a purposeful endeavor. A designer must first
          document the existing conditions of a problem, define its context, and collect relevant data to be
          assimilated and analyzed. This is the critical phase of the design process since the nature of a solution
          is
          inexorably related to how a problem is perceived, defined, and articulated. Piet Hein, the noted Danish
          poet
          and scientist, puts it this way: “Art is solving problems that cannot be formulated before they have been
          solved. </p>

        <p>The shaping of the question is part of the answer.” Designers inevitably and instinctively prefigure
          solutions to the problems they are confronted with, but the depth and range of their design vocabulary
          influence both their perception of a question and the shaping of its answer. If one's understanding of a
          design language is limited, then the range of possible solutions to a problem will also be limited. This
          book focuses, therefore, on broadening and enriching a vocabulary of design through the study of its
          essential elements and principles and the exploration of a wide array of solutions to architectural
          problems
          developed over the course of human history.</p>

        <p>As an art, architecture is more than satisfying the purely functional requirements of a building program.
          Fundamentally, the physical manifestations of architecture accommodate human activity. However, the
          arrangement and ordering of forms and spaces also determine how architecture might promote endeavors,
          elicit
          responses, and communicate meaning. So while this study focuses on formal and spatial ideas, it is not
          intended to diminish the importance of the social, political, or economic aspects of architecture. Form
          and
          space are presented not as ends in themselves but as means to solve a problem in response to conditions of
          function, purpose, and context—that is, architecturally.</p>

        <p>The analogy may be made that one must know and understand the alphabet before words can be formed and a
          vocabulary developed; one must understand the rules of grammar and syntax before sentences can be
          constructed; one must understand the principles of composition before essays, novels, and the like can be
          written. Once these elements are understood, one can write poignantly or with force, call for peace or
          incite to riot, comment on trivia or speak with insight and meaning. </p>

        <p>In a similar way, it might be appropriate to be able to recognize the basic elements of form and space
          and
          understand how they can be manipulated and organized in the development of a design concept, before
          addressing the more vital issue of meaning in architecture.</p>

        <p>In order to place this study in proper context, the following is an overview of the basic elements,
          systems, and orders that constitute a work of architecture. All of these constituents can be perceived and
          experienced. Some may be readily apparent while others are more obscure to our intellect and senses. Some
          may dominate while others play a secondary role in a building's organization. Some may convey images and
          meaning while others serve as qualifiers or modifiers of these messages.</p>

        <p>In all cases, however, these elements and systems should be interrelated to form an integrated whole
          having
          a unifying or coherent structure. Architectural order is created when the organization of parts makes
          visible their relationships to each other and the structure as a whole. When these relationships are
          perceived as mutually reinforcing and contributing to the singular nature of the whole, then a conceptual
          order exists—an order that may well be more enduring than transient perceptual visions.</p>
