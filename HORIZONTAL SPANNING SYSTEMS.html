        <h2>Types of Construction</h2>
      </header>

      <p>The material requirements for spanning structures are
        generally determined by the magnitude of the loads and
        the lengths of the spans. Another important consideration
        in selecting a structural material is the type of construction
        required by the building code for the size and occupancy
        of the building. </p>

      <p>Building codes classify the construction
        of a building according to the fire resistance of its major
        elements: structural frame, exterior and interior bearing
        walls, nonbearing walls and partitions, and floor and roof
        assemblies.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Type I buildings have their major building elements
            constructed of noncombustible materials, such as
            concrete, masonry, or steel. Some combustible materials
            are allowed if they are ancillary to the primary structure
            of the building. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Type II buildings are similar to Type I
            buildings except for a reduction in the required fire-
            resistance ratings of the major building elements.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Type III buildings have noncombustible exterior walls
            and major interior elements of any material permitted by
            the code.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Type IV buildings (Heavy Timber) have noncombustible
            exterior walls and major interior elements of solid or
            laminated wood of specified minimum sizes and without
            concealed spaces.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Type V buildings have structural elements, exterior
            walls, and interior walls of any material permitted by
            the code.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p> Protected construction requires all major building
            elements, except for nonbearing interior walls and
            partitions, to be of one-hour fire-resistive construction.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Unprotected construction has no requirements for fire-
            resistance except for when the code requires protection
            of exterior walls due to their proximity to a property line.</p>

        <h1>Structural Layers</h1>
      </header>
      <p>When supporting uniformly distributed loads, the first
        or surface-forming layer should be selected for greatest
        efficiency. Thus, the selection of structural members for a
        spanning system and the spacing between them begins
        at the point of application of the live load. The load is
        gathered through successive layers of structure until it is
        resolved at the foundation. Typically, greater spans will
        result in more layers to reduce the amount of material
        used, resulting in greater efficiency.</p>

      <header>
        <h2>Layer 1</h2>
      </header>
      <ul>
        <p>Layer 1 is the uppermost surface-forming
          layer and may consist of:</p>

        <li>
          <p>Structural wood panels</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Wood or steel decking</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Precast concrete planks</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Cast-in-place concrete slabs</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The load-carrying and spanning capability
            of these surface-forming elements
            determines the size and spacing of
            Layer 2 joists and beams.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <header>
        <h2>Layer 2</h2>
      </header>
      <ul>
        <p>Layer 2 supports the surface-forming layer
          and may consist of:</p>

        <li>
          <p>Wood and light-gauge steel joists</p>
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>In lieu of the third horizontal layer, a series

      <header>
        <h1>Construction Depth</h1>
      </header>

      <p>The depth of a floor or roof system is directly related
        to the size and proportion of the structural bays it must
        span, the magnitude of the live loads, and the strength of
        the materials used. The structural depth of floor and roof
        systems becomes critical in areas where zoning ordinances
        restrict building heights and maximizing the usable floor
        area is important to the economic feasibility of a project. </p>

      <p>For floor systems between habitable spaces stacked one
        above the other, additional factors to consider are the
        blockage of both airborne and structure-borne sound and
        the fire-resistance rating of the assembly.</p>

      <ul>
        <p>The following points can be applied to both steel and
          timber spanning systems.</p>

        <li>
          <p>The structural layers of a spanning system either can be
            stacked atop of one another or be formed or framed in
            the same plane.</p>
        </li>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/Horizontal Spans/structural layers.png" alt="HORIZONTAL SPANNING"
            style="height: 24%; width: 36%;">
        </figure> <br><br>

        <li>
          <p>Stacking the layers increases the construction depth but
            enables one-way spanning elements to overhang in the
            direction of their span.</p>
        </li>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/Horizontal Spans/Stacking the layers.png" alt="HORIZONTAL SPANNING"
            style="height: 24%; width: 36%;">
        </figure> <br><br>

        <li>
          <p>Stacking one layer atop the supporting layer below
            provides space for other systems to cross over the
            supporting layer between members of the supported
            layer.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The layers may be formed or framed in plane to
            minimize the construction depth. In this case, the depth
            of the largest spanning elements, such as girders or
            trusses, establishes the overall depth of the system.</p>
        </li>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/Horizontal Spans/formed or framed.png" alt="HORIZONTAL SPANNING"
            style="height: 24%; width: 60%;">
        </figure> <br><br>

        <li>
          <p>In some cases, the overall depth of a spanning structure
            can be reduced further by integrating the mechanical
            and structural systems so that they occupy the same
            volume rather than exist in separate layers. This,
            however, requires careful study since this may require
            penetrating structural members, which can cause
            localized stresses.</p>
        </li>

      </ul>

      <p>The sizing and proportioning of structural elements and
        assemblies requires an understanding of the context in
        which each element or assembly is used—the type of
        loads being carried and what is supporting the element or
        assembly.</p>

        combination of dead loads, live loads, and lateral loads.
        Just as important as the magnitude of these loads is
        the manner in which the loads are applied to a spanning
        structure. Loads may be applied either in a distributed or
        a concentrated manner.</p>

      <p>Understanding this distinction is
        important because some structural systems are better
        suited for carrying relatively light, uniformly distributed
        loads while others are more appropriate for supporting a
        set of concentrated loads.</p>

      <p>Many floor and roof structures are subject to relatively
        light, distributed loading. In these cases, when stiffness
        and resistance to deflection tend to govern the design
        of the structure, it is usually appropriate to select a
        distributed type of structure using a number of relatively
        smaller, more closely spaced spanning elements, such as
        joists. Distributed structural systems, however, are not well
        suited to carrying concentrated loads, which require fewer
        and larger one-way spanning elements such as girders and
        trusses for their support.</p>

      <p>A uniformly distributed load is one of uniform
        magnitude extending over the length or area of
        the supporting structural element, as in the case
        of the self-weight of the structure, the live load
        on a floor deck, snow load on a roof, or a wind
        load on a wall. Building codes specify minimum
        uniformly distributed unit loads for various uses
        and occupancies.</p>

          alt="HORIZONTAL SPANNING" style="height: 24%; width: 39%;">
      </figure> <br><br>

      <p>A concentrated load acts on a very small area
        or particular point of a supporting structural
        element, as when a beam bears on a column, a
        column bears on a girder, or a truss bears on a
        bearing wall.</p>

      <p>Concentrated loads are of particular concern
        because the effect of concentrating a
        distributed load in the center of a span doubles
        the bending moment on the spanning member.
        For this reason it is always preferable to locate
        a column or bearing wall directly under a
        concentrated load.</p>

        <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/Horizontal Spans/concentrated load.jpg" alt="HORIZONTAL SPANNING"
          style="height: 24%; width: 33%;">
      </figure> <br><br>

      <p>When this is not possible, a transfer beam is
        used to transfer the load to vertical supports.</p>

        <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/Horizontal Spans/transfer beam.jpg" alt="HORIZONTAL SPANNING"
          style="height: 24%; width: 33%;">
      </figure> <br><br>

      <p>Because it must safely support moving loads,
        a floor system should be relatively stiff while
        maintaining its elasticity. Due to the detrimental
        effects that excessive deflection and vibration
        would have on finish flooring and ceiling
        materials, as well as on human comfort,
        deflection rather than bending often becomes
        the critical controlling factor in the design of
        floor systems.</p>

        <h2>Load Tracing</h2>
      </header>
      <p>Load tracing is the process of modeling how a structure
        collects, channels, and redirects the loads resulting from
        external forces through the hierarchy of its members to
        the foundation and underlying soil. The analysis usually
        starts at the roof level with the smallest members actually
        picking up the loading, and proceeds by tracing the loads
        through each collecting member. The reactions of each
        member to its loading become forces on the supporting
        members in the next layer.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Dead loads are static loads acting
            vertically downward on a structure,
            comprising the self-weight of the
            structure and the weight of building
            fixtures and equipment permanently
            attached to it.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Live loads comprise moving or movable
            loads on a structure resulting from
            occupancy, collected snow and water,
            or portable equipment.</p>
        </li>

        <ul>

          <li>
            <p>The hierarchical sequence of load tracing is generally
              the same for concrete, steel, and timber spanning
              systems.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Surface-forming structures, such as structural sheathing
              or decking, distribute the applied load to its supporting
              joists or beams in the form of a distributed load.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Beams transfer the applied distributed load horizontally
              to supporting girders, trusses, columns, or bearing wall.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Tributary area is the portion of a structure contributing to
              the load on a structural element or member.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Load strip is the tributary area per unit length of a
              supporting structural member.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Tributary load is the load on a structural element or
              member collected from its tributary area.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Bearing refers to a point, surface, or mass that supports
              weight, especially the area of contact between a
              bearing member, as a beam or truss, and a column,
              wall, or other underlying support.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> Support condition refers to the manner in which a
              structural member is supported and connected to other
              members, affecting the nature of the reactive forces
              developed on the loaded member.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Anchorage refers to the means for binding a structural
              member to another or to its foundation, often to resist
              uplifting and horizontal forces.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Rigid floor planes can also be designed to serve as
              horizontal diaphragms which act as thin, wide beams in
              transferring lateral forces to shear walls. See Chapter 5
              for a more detailed discussion of the various methods
              for providing lateral stability.</p>

      <p>The dimensions and proportions of the bays defined by
        a structural grid influence—and may often limit—the
        material and structural choices of the horizontal spanning
        systems.</p>

      <header>
        <h2>Material</h2>
      </header>

      <p>Both wood and steel spanning elements lend
        themselves to one-way systems, while concrete is
        appropriate for both one-way and two-way spanning
        systems.</p>

      <header>
        <h2>Bay Proportion</h2>
      </header>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p> Two-way systems are best used to span square or
            nearly square bays.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>While two-way spanning systems require square or
            nearly square bays, the converse is not necessarily true.
            One-way systems are flexible and can span in either
            direction of either square or rectangular structural bays.</p>
        </li>

        <h2>Span Direction</h2>
      </header>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The direction of horizontal spans, as determined by
            the location and orientation of the vertical supporting
            planes, affects the nature of the spatial composition, the
            qualities of the spaces defined, and to some extent, the
            economics of construction.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>One-way joists and beams can span in either the
            short or long direction of rectangular bays, with their
            supporting beams, columns, or bearing walls spanning
            in an alternate, usually perpendicular direction.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <header>
        <h2>Span Length</h2>
      </header>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The spacing of supporting columns and bearing walls
            determines the length of horizontal spans.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Certain materials have an appropriate range of bay
            spans. For example, the various types of cast-in-place
            concrete slabs have bay spans in the range from 6 to
            38 feet (1.8 to 12 m). Steel is a more flexible material
            because its spanning elements are manufactured in
            different forms, from beams to open-web joists and
            trusses, which can span from 15 to 80 feet (5 to 24 m).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The orientation and length of overhangs and size and
            location of openings within the floor plane should be
            considered in the layout of the structural supports for
            the floor. The edge conditions of the floor structure
            and its connection to supporting foundation and wall
            systems affect both the structural integrity of a building
            and its physical appearance.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>One-way systems of joists, planks, or slabs are more
            efficient when structural bays are rectangular—that
            is, when the ratio of the long to the short dimensions
            is greater than 1.5:1—or when the structural grid
            generates a linear pattern of spaces.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The parallel nature of loadbearing walls leads naturally
            to the use of one-way spanning systems.</p>
        </li>

        </figure> <br><br>

        <li>
          <p>Because loadbearing walls are most effective when
            supporting a uniformly distributed load, they typically
            support a series of joists, planks, or a one-way slab.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The most common two-way systems are reinforced
            concrete slabs used to span square or nearly square
            bays.</p>

        <li>
          <p> Two loadbearing walls naturally define an axial,
