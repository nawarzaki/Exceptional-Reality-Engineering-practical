        <h1>Spanning Options</h1>
      </header>

      <p>Creating a spatial volume requires a minimum of two
        vertically oriented support planes, be they column-and-
        beam frames, bearing walls, or a combination thereof. To
        provide shelter against the vagaries of weather as well
        as a sense of enclosure, some sort of spanning system is
        required to bridge the space between the support systems. </p>

      <p>In looking at the fundamental ways of spanning the space
        between two support planes, we must consider both the
        way applied forces are distributed to the supporting planes
        as well as the form of the spanning system.</p>

      <header>
        <h2>One-Way Spanning Systems</h2>
      </header>

      <p>Whether the spanning system transfers and distributes
        applied forces in one or two (or even multiple) directions
        will determine the pattern of supports required. As the
        name implies, one-way systems transfer applied forces
        to a pair of more or less parallel supporting planes. This
        configuration naturally leaves two sides of the spatial
        unit open to adjacent spaces, giving it a strong directional
        quality.</p>


      <header>
        <h2>Two-Way Spanning Systems</h2>
      </header>

      <p>On the other hand, two-way systems transfer applied
        forces in two directions, requiring two sets of supporting
        planes or columns, more or less perpendicular to each
        other and the direction of transfer of forces.</p>

      </figure> <br><br>

      <ul>
        <p>In determining whether to use one-way or two-way
          systems, consideration must be given to a number of
          variables:</p>

        <li>
          <p>Dimensions, scale, and proportions of structural bay</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Structural materials employed</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Depth of construction assembly</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <header>
        <h2>Structural Grids</h2>
      </header>
      <p>A grid is a pattern of straight lines, usually equally spaced
        and intersecting at right angles, that serves as a reference
        for locating points on a map or plan. In architectural
        design, a grid is often used as an ordering device not only
        for locating but also for regulating the major elements of
        a plan. When we speak of a structural grid, therefore, we
        are referring specifically to a system of lines and points
        for locating and regulating the position of major structural
        elements, such as columns and bearing walls.</p>

        <figcaption>
          <p><b>The parallel lines of a plan grid indicate the

              combination thereof.</b></p>
          <p><b>Because curved beams are subject to torsion, they are more

              simply spanning beams. Bearing walls, however, can be

        <li>
          <p>Even though a grid is primarily a plan device, it can be
            extended into the third dimension to regulate the height

        <li>
          <p>The principal vertical supports of a structure
            naturally mark and define a series of structural
            bays —the major spatial divisions across which
            structural elements and assemblies must span.</p>
        </li>

      </ul>

      <p>In developing a structural grid for a building concept,
        there are important grid characteristics that must be
        considered for their impact on the architectural idea,
        the accommodation of program activities, as well as the
        design of the structure.</p>

      <header>
        <h2>Proportions</h2>
      </header>

      <p>The proportions of the structural bays influence, and may
        limit, the material and structural choices of the horizontal
        spanning systems. While one-way systems are flexible and
        can span in either direction of either square or rectangular
        structural bays, two-way systems are best used to span
        square or nearly square bays.</p>

      <header>
        <h2>Dimensions</h2>
      </header>

      <ul>
        <p>The dimensions of the structural bays obviously impact
          both the direction and length of the horizontal spans. </p>

        <li>
          <h4>Direction of spans</h4>
          <p>The direction of horizontal spans, as determined by
            the location and orientation of the vertical supporting
            planes, affects the nature of the spatial composition, the
            qualities of the spaces defined, and to some extent, the
            economics of construction.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h4>Span lengths</h4>
          <p>The spacing of the vertical supporting planes determines
            the length of the horizontal spans, which, in turn,
            affects the choice of materials and the type of spanning
            system employed. The greater the span, the deeper the
            spanning system will have to be.</p>
        </li>

      <header>
        <h2>Scale</h2>
      </header>

      <ul>
        <p>
          In design, scale refers to the proportionate size or extent
          of an element or composition when judged in relation
          to some norm or standard. We use such terms as large-
          scale, small-scale, fine and coarse, to describe how we
          perceive or judge the relative sizes of things.</p>

        <p> In developing
          a structural grid, we can refer to its scale as well, judging
          the relative fineness or coarseness of the dimensions and
          proportions of the bays against what we might consider to
          be normal. The scale of a structural grid is related to:</p>

        <li>
          <p>the type of human activity to be accommodated;</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>the efficient span range for a particular spanning
            system; </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>the nature of the foundation soil of the building site.</p>
        </li>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/STRUCTURAL PATTERNS/scale.jpg" alt="STRUCTURAL PATTERNS"
            style="height: 24%; width: 48%;">
          <figcaption>
            <p><b>Scale</b></p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure> <br><br>
      </ul>

      <p>Another aspect of scale is the relative sizes of the
        members used. Some structures can be seen to be
        concentrated in nature due to their use of relatively large
        members carrying concentrated loads. On the other hand,
        there are some structures that use a multiplicity of small
        members that distribute their loads among a large number
        of relatively small members.</p>

      <p>A final attribute of some structural systems is its grain,
        as determined by the direction, size, and arrangement of
        its spanning elements.</p>

      <figure>

      <header>
        <h2>Spatial Fit</h2>
      </header>

      <p>The nature, pattern, and scale of vertical supports
        suggested by a structural grid not only influence the
        type of spanning system used but also the arrangement
        of vertical supports should accommodate the intended
        patterns and scale of human activity. At a minimum, the
        vertical support pattern should not limit the usefulness of a
        space nor constrain its intended activities.</p>

      <p>Those activities requiring large clear spans will often
        dictate the structural approach, but smaller-scale activities
        can usually be accommodated by a variety of structural
        approaches. Illustrated on this and the facing page are
        various types and scales of structural patterns and the
        pattern and scale of human activity each might be able to
        accommodate.</p>
