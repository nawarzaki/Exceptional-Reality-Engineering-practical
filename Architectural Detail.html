          <h2>Architectural Detail</h2>
        </header>

        <p>Architectural details are permanent features such as stairs, doors, windows, panels, moldings, trim,
          chimneypieces, fireplaces, and cabinetwork. During a given historic era, certain details were popular
          and
          commonly used. </p>

        <p>The details became typical of the period, and today they are an important key to identifying rooms of a
          particular era. Now, as in times past, designers and builders choose de-tails to provide an element of
          finish in an interior, as well as to make the design more interesting and appealing.</p>

      </div>

      <div id="Walls">
        <header>
          <h3>Walls</h3>
        </header>
        <p>In common dwellings from many periods, the wall treatment was generally the same as the building
          materials.
        </p>

        <p>For example, medieval interiors often included a timber framework and stucco infill as a wall
          treatment.
          They might also have stone walls left plain, stuccoed with rough plaster, or simply whitewashed. </p>

        <p>Panels of wood that were joined (fitted together) and carved like furniture were used in the great
          churches
          of the Middle Ages. This type of paneling was also used in castles and manor houses as a barrier from
          the
          dampness of stone walls and as a form of decoration. This paneling, which usually reached above the
          level of
          the doors, was called a wainscot. </p>

        <p>The wood was framed in small vertical panels that were carved with a motif resembling a stylized piece
          of
          folded linen called linen fold. Wainscoting in this style was also popular in some interiors from the
          nineteenth and twentieth centuries. These more recent wainscots were frequently finished at the top with
          a
          plate rail (a narrow shelf used to display plates).</p>

        <p>The Renaissance brought a return to classicism, and the designs of Rome became the basis for most wall
          detailing. The Roman temple was built with columns resting on a raised podium. The columns supported a
          complete entablature, including an architrave, frieze, and cornice. During the Renaissance the exterior
          details of the Roman temple were translated into interior wall details, executed in materials such as
          wood,
          plaster, and marble. </p>

        <p>The podium became the dado (the lower portion of a wall set apart by moldings). The columns were
          applied
          decoratively as flat pilasters with appropriate bases and capitals (also treated in a flat manner), and
          the
          entablature was interpreted as a series of moldings where the wall meets the ceiling. </p>

        <p>The spaces between the pilasters were filled with molded panels that varied in size and style. During
          certain periods the pilasters disappeared, leaving just the simple panels. These basic classical details
          have been re-interpreted many times in every culture touched by the Renaissance.</p>

        <p>Certainly, one of the most popular treatments through the years has been panels of wood. However, the
          influence of the International style (with its lack of historical ornament) and the rising cost of fine
          historic detailing have made historic paneling less common. In some historically styled homes and in
          certain
          contract settings requiring a traditional feeling, paneled walls are still used</p>

          <h3>Wood Paneling</h3>
        </header>

        <p>The three most common panel types are traditional, board and batten, and tongue and groove </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Traditional paneling is made with panels that may be flat, beveled (perimeter of panel is cut at an
              angle to meet the frame), or raised (panel projects beyond the frame). The panels are framed with
              stiles
              (vertical part of the frame) and rails (horizontal part of the frame). The frames are joined with
              mortise-and-Tenon or dowel joints. The frame is grooved where the panel and the frame are joined,
              and a
              small space is left to allow for expansion and contraction of the panel.</p>

            <p>Beadboard is a type of nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century paneling that be-came very popular
              again
              at the end of the last century and the beginning of the new millennium because it is so well suited
              to
              informal vernacular/country-style design. It is made with narrow vertical strips separated by a
              rounded
              vertical bead. </p>
            <p>The fiberboard paneling comes prefinished or primed, ready for painting. Beadboard is often used as
              a
              wainscot or dado.</p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Board and batten is paneling made from wide vertical boards. The gap between the boards is covered
              with
              a 2.5cm by 5cm strip of wood called a batten. </p>
            <p>This type of paneling was used in America during the seventeenth century to cover the fireplace
              wall,
              creating what was referred to as a palisade wall. Reverse board and batten produces the opposite
              effect
              of boards with a wide reveal or groove between.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Tongue-and-groove paneling consists of boards coped (cut to fit an adjoining piece) with a
              projecting
              tongue on one edge that matches and fits into the recessed groove on the opposite edge. The two
              edges of
              the board are generally beveled producing a V-shaped groove where the boards meet. The groove hides
              any
              irregularities in the thickness of the boards. Inexpensive plywood or pressboard paneling sheets are
              produced to imitate the look of genuine tongue-and-groove paneling.</p>

          <h3> Moldings </h3>
        </header>
        <ul>
          <p> Moldings are trims used to create decorative effects. At the same time, they may cover the
            unfinished
            ragged
            edges of the wall left in the construction process. Moldings are frequently made of wood that can be
            worked
            easily—most often pine and oak. Mitering the corners (cutting and fitting together the trim at a
            45-degree
            angle) allows for a pleasing fit where pieces are joined. Moldings may be stained or painted.</p>

          <p>When they are painted the same color as the walls, they tend to have less visual importance. When
            they
            are painted to contrast with the walls, they become a more dynamic feature of the room. Following is a
            list of trim types:</p>

          <li>
            <p>Base describes the molding used to finish the wall where it meets the floor. Any workable material,
              including rubber or plastic, can be used to make a base.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Baseboard designates bases of wood. The base hides any slight irregularities in the level of the
              floor
              and keeps the wall from being scuffed by vacuums or other equipment. This trim is sometimes called a
              mopboard because it protects the wall during cleaning.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Chair rail is a molding placed at the usual height of a chair back to protect the wall from damage.
              If
              the section below the rail is paneled, dado fashion, the trim is called a dado cap. The portion
              below
              the rail is sometimes called a wainscot, although wainscot is a term better used to describe a
              door-height section of paneling. The height of the chair rail may vary from approximately 75cm to
              90cm.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Crown or bed moldings are placed where the wall meets the ceiling to add a finishing touch to
              traditionally styled rooms. They are generally simple; the more complex and ornate ceiling molding
              is
              called cornice molding.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Cornice moldings often include decorative ornamentation such as the acanthus leaf, egg and dart,
              modillions, or dentils.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Cove molding is a rounded piece placed where the wall meets the ceiling. It makes a clean smooth
              transition from the ceiling to the wall.
            </p>

          <h3>Doors</h3>
        </header>
        <p>The selection of a door is important for practical reasons. Major considerations are security against
          breakage and unlawful entry, upkeep with regard to climate and the amount of wear and tear it will
          receive,
          and protection against fire (burn time). </p>
        <p>Beyond these crucial safety and maintenance factors come the considerations of initial cost and upkeep
          cost. Upkeep considerations include painting, refinishing, and ability to withstand breaking or
          shattering.
          The initial cost should be balanced with the upkeep costs. When these considerations are met, aesthetics
          will be the determining factor in style selection.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <p>Doors fall Into two basic categories, paneled doors and flush doors:</p>
          <li>
            <p>Traditional paneled doors of wood are made in the same manner as traditional wooden wall panels.
              This
              type of door consists of wooden stiles and rails that secure the molded panels.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Flush doors, as the name indicates, are flat with no raised or sunken panels. They are made of wood
              using two principal methods. The first utilizes a solid core of wood, also called lumber core. In
              this
              type of construction, a thin cross banding (veneer with a horizontal grain) is laminated (glued) to
              a
              core of wood blocks that has been framed with rails and stiles. </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The door is finished with a vertical-grained face veneer. The second type is hollow core, which is made
          with a stile-and-rail frame filled with a lightweight honeycomb of cardboard and covered with as many as
          three veneers of thin wood. These doors are not as strong as the lumber-core type.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/architectural details/door.jpg" alt="door" style="height: 30%; width:40% ;">
        </figure>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Metal doors, once used only for areas with serious security problems, today have become quite
              acceptable in most settings. They are now made of steel and filled with a core of high-density
              polystyrene or polyurethane plastic foam, which makes them well insulated. </p>
            <p>Compared to wooden doors, metal doors are less subject to dimension changes resulting from
              temperature
              and humidity shifts. They can be formed in traditional paneled styles or fitted with panes of glass,
              and
              when painted, they are almost indistinguishable from wooden doors when seen from a distance.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>High-strength tempered glass doors in metal frames (or unframed) are functional, particularly in
              contract settings, because they permit visibility in areas of high traffic and allow passersby to
              see
              into areas where products or services are available.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Glass doors with metal or wooden frames make inviting entrances to patios or balconies or
              attractive
              dividers between rooms. When the glass is leaded (smaller pieces held together with lead strips),
              beveled (edges cut at an angle), or stained (colored leaded glass), it creates beautiful effects
              with
              light and can be an important decorative feature of the interior. Sliding glass doors have become
              less
              popular because they are heavy and difficult to operate. They often develop problems with their
              glides
              (sliding tracks) and are also difficult to secure.</p>

            <p>Molded plastic doors in many designs, including the traditional paneled type, are available today.
              They
              may be embossed with a faint wood grain or perfectly smooth. When painted, they have the appearance
              of a
              wooden door, especially from a distance.</p>

          <p>Several other types of doors are seen in today's interiors. Among the most important are those
            described
            below:</p>

          <li>
            <p>Pocket doors glide on a metal track from which they are suspended. When they are opened, they slide
              into a recessed pocket in the framing of the wall. They come as a pre-framed pack-age that is
              installed
              during the framing phase of the construction process. They are particularly advantageous in areas
              where
              a door that swings open would be in the way.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Bifold doors are hinged with two sections. One section is anchored on the side, both top and
              bottom, so
              that the doors pivot and glide freely. They are kept in place by a small wheel fixed to the top of
              the
              unanchored section that guides the door along a metal track fixed to the top frame of the door. They
              stack against the doorjamb and project slightly into the room when open. They are also used in
              double
              configurations with four sections that stack on both sides of wider doors.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Accordion doors are made with narrow panels of wood, metal, or plastic. They fold accordion-style
              on a
              track from which they are suspended, and they stack neatly in a small space.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Louvered doors are wooden-framed with angled louvers or slats like shutters. Louvered doors allow
              circulation of air yet still provide visual privacy. They are commonly installed on closets or other
              spaces where air circulation is advisable. Louvered panels are used on pocket doors, bifold doors,
              and
              standard doors.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>French doors are double doors similar to paneled doors, but the wooden frames are filled with glass
              rather than wooden panels. One door is often kept latched in place and the other is used for
              passage.
              New French-type doors with one permanently stationary door are called atrium or patio doors and
              frequently replace sliding glass doors.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Dutch doors break horizontally in two sections so that each can open or shut separately or the two
              can
              be latched together into a single door. They may have windows in the top section. Dutch doors were
              originally designed to admit fresh air through the opening above and to keep out animals by closing
              the
              section below. In contract settings, Dutch doors are used for service areas to keep out unauthorized
              traffic yet still allow communication or act as a service counter.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Shoji screens are Japanese sliding panels made with wooden frames filled with oriental paper (or
              frosted glass or Plexiglas). A grid is placed on one or both sides to divide the screen into panes
              that
              resemble traditional windows. </p>

            <p>The grids can be simple rectangles or quite complex and ingenious in their design. They were used
              like
              sliding walls as dividers in the traditional Japanese house and are used today in some Western
              interiors
              for the same purpose or for a purely decorative effect.</p>

              columns, entablature, and raised
              podium.</figcaption>

          <h3>Windows</h3>
        </header>

        <ul>
          <p>Through windows we look out at the world and the world looks in at us. The placement of windows not
            only
            is important to the wall composition of the interior but largely determines the fenestration
            (architectural arrangement of windows)—a crucial part of the style and character of the exterior. Some
            major considerations in the selection and placement of windows follow:</p>
          <li>
            <p>Security. Windows are the easiest point of unlawful entry; the greater the quantity and the more
              accessible and poorly lit the windows are on the exterior, the greater that risk.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Orientation and solar gain. Where solar gain is desirable, windows should be most plentiful on the
              south of the building and least plentiful on the north. Limiting their number, strategically placing
              them, and protecting against bright sun on the east and the west orientations are imperative. Light
              is
              clearest and most steady from the north, most warm and constant on the south, clearest and brightest
              on
              the east, and most colored and hottest on the west.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Quantity of light desired. Great quantities of light can be healthful to mind and body, yet when
              accompanied by heat and glare, light can be emotionally and physically unhealthy. Too much light and
              heat can also be damaging to interior furnishings.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The view. Windows should be planned to frame any pleasant view. The view can serve to visually
              expand
              space and bring the exterior into the interior as an extension of the design.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Privacy. The location, the height of the wall, and the number of windows can largely determine the
              amount of privacy afforded the occupant. Windows high in the wall give greater privacy, as do
              smaller
              windows.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        <ul>
          <p>Windows have evolved from crude openings draped with animal skins to Medieval leaded panes to large
            Late
            Renaissance windows to the glass houses of the twentieth century. Not surprisingly, glass has been an
            important part of that evolution. Setting the glass in place is called glazing and can be done with
            one or
            more sheets of glass:</p>

          <li>
            <p>A single layer of glass is called single glazing.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Double glazing, or thermal pane, is two sheets of glass sandwiched in a frame to deter heat and/or
              cold
              transfer.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Energy efficiency can be further enhanced with the addition of a third sheet of glass to produce
              triple
              glazing. This is often used for winter storm windows.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Arched and round windows have been appreciated for centuries. The Palladian window, previously
              mentioned, is an arched window with two lower sidelights framed with classical columns, pilasters,
              and
              moldings. </p>
            <p>The fanlight is also an elliptic arch form of the Neoclassic era. Round porthole windows were
              especially popular during the Victorian era and may be seen in some vintage houses. Hexagonal
              windows
              are six-sided variations of the rounded window.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Awning windows are hinged on the top to swing outward at an angle like an awning. They may be
              stacked
              or grouped in horizontal bands along a high wall, clerestory fashion, for privacy. They may also be
              used
              as the bottom component in a sashlike window or some other window arrangement. They have the
              advantage
              of being able to remain open in a rainstorm.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Bay and bow windows are projecting windows. The bay is canted (angular) or projects straight out,
              and
              the bow has a curved projection. Bay and bow windows provide attractive interest to the exterior of
              a
              building. They add extra space to the interior, as well as admit light. They may, however, be costly
              to
              drape because they require custom drapery rods.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Casement windows are side-hinged, swinging windows. They are an important historical style popular
              in
              many countries. Casement windows may be used as operable sections beside large, fixed picture
              windows.
              They have great appeal because they provide maxi-mum ventilation, and if they swing out, they keep
              the
              interior free for draperies or other window treatments.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The clerestory was the highest window in the Gothic church, and today clerestory windows are still
              those that are set high in the wall. These windows may be for light only or for light and
              ventilation.
              They may be of almost any style; it is their location at the top of the wall that makes them
              clerestory.
              They provide light while ensuring privacy.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Cathedral windows are angled, A-frame windows that follow the pitch of a vaulted ceiling. They
              embody a
              strong architectural quality that makes them particularly well suited to contemporary interiors.
              They
              work best in settings with pleasant views where no window coverings are necessary.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The greenhouse window is a projecting glass box used to catch the sun's rays. Some may be just
              large
              enough to fill a kitchen window, and others may be room size. Like botanical greenhouses, they are
              ideal
              for plants; the room-size version can also be a favored spot for dining and relaxing. They can also
              be
              de-signed as sunrooms with hot tubs, spas, or comfortable areas for conversation and relaxation.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The jalousie window is made with a set of louvered slats that tilt open and closed. The principal
              benefit of this window is the ability to provide ventilation while restricting entrance of rain. The
              name is French for 'jealousy'; a wooden blind, slatted like the jalousie window, may have allowed
              jealous lovers to see in without being seen.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The sash window is made with two window panels designed to slide up and down in a vertical channel
              of
              the window frame. The panels may be larger, single sheets of glass or may be divided into several
              smaller panes. The smaller-paned windows were designated historically by the number of “lights”
              (panes)
              in each panel; for example, twelve over twelve indicates twelve panes in the top frame and twelve in
              the
              bottom, and six over six indicates six above and six below. </p>

            <p>A single-hung sash window has an operable lower window that can be raised and lowered. In the
              double-hung sash window, both sashes are operable, allowing good air circulation. Cooler air enters
              through the lower opening, and warm air rises out through the top.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>A sidelight is a narrow window next to a door. A pair of sidelights is used to flank a door. A
              transom
              is a window above a door. Arched transom windows are called fanlights. In older buildings, operable
              transoms were often used between rooms to improve air circulation.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Skylights are custom-installed or prefabricated units mounted in the roof and ceiling to bring
              natural
              light into interiors that have no direct access to windows and would otherwise be dark. Light pipes
              require only small roof openings, as they use mirror-like inserts to magnify the light they admit.
              Skylights are made of glass, plastic, or Plexiglas.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Attic windows are operable pivoting windows placed in an angled roof in lieu of dormers. They are
              less
              expensive than framing a dormer and admit more light. They are utilized in new construction and
              remodeling projects where unused attic space is being trans-formed into living or working space.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Sliding windows are technically the same as sash windows but are designed to slide horizontally. A
              sliding window may be a single operable panel of a larger window. Sliding windows may be framed in
              wood
              or vinyl-clad wood as well as aluminum.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
