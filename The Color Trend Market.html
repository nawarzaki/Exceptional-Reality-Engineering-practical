            <h3>Color in Residential Interiors</h3>
          </header>
          <p>In the home we are free to select colors
            that are the most personally appealing. </p>

          <p>When color schemes are neutralized, children and extended-family members accessories may be changed
            with
            the seasons or moods.
            Smaller colored areas that are bright and cheerful might
            be preferred by younger children.</p>

          <p>Color in homes can be tailor-made to individual needs beyond age. People who are housebound or prone to
            depression can be cheered with warm, encouraging colors.
            People with poor eyesight may benefit from light, clear color and value. Those who need reassuring
            environments
            in which to work at home can select colors that are calming or stable. Various task or hobby areas
            within
            the home
            can also be outfitted for individuality. Living areas where
            people congregate or are entertained should be neutralized enough to be generally appealing to everyone.
          </p>

          <p>Ask yourself, “Will I still want
            this pattern-texture-color combination in 10 years?” If
            you sincerely think you will, it is probably a good color
            choice.</p> <br>

          </header>

          <ul>
            <p>Color in public and in work spaces is a complex topic. For example, color in medical facilities will
              often
              be handled differently than in hospitality interiors, office interiors,
              retail businesses, or production or assembly-line facilities. The differences lie in the specialized
              needs
              of the users of these various environments. Designers must be knowledgeable about and sensitive to
              these
              needs, which govern emotional responses, since they can affect behavior, attitude, productivity, or
              patronization.
            </p>

            <li>
              <header>
                <h4>Medical Facilities</h4>
              </header>
              <p>In hospitals, doctors' offices, outpatient facilities, and geriatric facilities, the philosophy of
                color
                has changed significantly in the past several years. Medical facilities used to be white or pale
                tints,
                cool-looking, and full of hard surfaces, an echo of the sterile environment. Today, we know from
                research
                that soft or neutralized colors in a variety of values, from dark to light, can promote healing.
                Also,
                colored background elements are no longer always hard. </p>
              <p>Medical facilities often incorporate carpet, warm wood textures, and fireproof fabric or wall
                coverings
                on
                the partitions and walls. This offers a more human, caring atmosphere to persons in sometimes
                frightening
                and bewildering circumstances.</p>

              <header>
                <h4>Hospitality Facilities</h4>
              </header>
              <p>Interiors of hotels and motels, resorts and spas, and restaurants are areas where color and design
                are
                dictated by the culture and the climate. Lavish colors and patterns may dominate reception areas and
                rooms and suites.
                In restaurants, red- and orange-related hues are found to be the most stimulating to the appetite,
                and
                colors that complement the food color enhance the visual appeal and flavor of the food. Where
                climates
                are
                very warm, cooler colors are often used, and in colder climates, warmer colors are often more
                welcoming.

                <h4>Ofﬁce Interiors</h4>
              </header>
              <p>Office interiors have become sophisticated in terms of equipment and furniture systems and the use
                of
                computers to simplify procedures, storage, and retrieval systems (“the paperless office”). Color
                trends
                are
                reflected in contemporary office design, with neutralized hues and complex neutrals considered most
                professional.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <header>
                <h4>Retail Businesses</h4>
              </header>
              <p>The objective of design for retail businesses is to entice customers to purchase goods and
                services.
                Stimulating, warm, cheerful, and advancing colors are often utilized in large stores and shopping
                malls,
                where the bright colors help customers locate departments and services.
              </p>
              <p>To an extent, glitter and neon-bright colors have been incorporated into retail businesses that
                appeal
                to
                youth. The use of subtle, deep-value tones and neutralized pastels, accented with pure chroma, with
                polished
                wood and metal gives retail businesses an exclusive or rich appearance. This method does not
                necessarily
                limit the clientele to those with money. Rather, it is aimed toward making customers feel that they
                deserve
                quality merchandise and can afford it. White, neutrals, and neutralized hues form a background for
                colorful
                merchandise and provide flexibility.</p>

              <figcaption>A discussion between a businesswoman and businessman may be even, fair, and honest, as it
                takes
                place over a
                peaceful green carpet. This is an excellent application of color
                psychology.</figcaption>
