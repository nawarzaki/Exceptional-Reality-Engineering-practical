            <h2>Active and Passive Solar Systems</h2>
          </header>

          <p>Many buildings incorporate active or passive solar heating. The designer needs to understand the terms
            and
            concepts of solar energy so that the interior design may
            complement and augment the system.</p>

          <ol>
            <h3>Active Solar Systems</h3>
            <p>An active solar system is made of mechanical parts that
              convert incident solar radiation (insolation) to thermal
              energy to warm air space, heat water, and even run airconditioning units. The system consists of six
              basic
              components that may be altered as needed:</p>

            <li>
              <p>Collectors capture or collect the sun's warmth by
                means of panels mounted to face the sun at approximately 90-degree angles. They may be focusing
                (like a
                magnifying glass) or nonfocusing (like a green house heating a material, which in turn heats a gas
                or
                liquid
                medium).</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>This thermal energy is moved by transport, usually
                via a fluid or air, from the collectors. This may require
                pumps, valves, and pipes for liquid transport or blowers, dampers, and ducts for hot air.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The transport component moves the heat to storage,
                a reservoir that stores the thermal energy. It may be
                simple or complex, made of water, rocks, aluminum
                oxide, or other materials. The storage ensures warmth at night and on cloudy days when no thermal
                energy
                is being collected.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Distribution carries the heat through pipes and ducts
                to the space to be heated. It usually requires larger
                ducts and radiating surfaces than conventional furnace systems.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Auxiliary heating is usually a central or localized
                system. Hooked into the solar distribution unit, the
                furnace is capable of taking over heating needs if the
                active solar system cannot produce enough heat on
                successive sunless days.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Control, perhaps in the form of a thermostat, is an automatic or a manual system to control heat
                and
                energy
                flow.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <ol>

              <h3>Passive Solar Systems</h3>
            </header>
            <p>Passive designs share common aspects with active systems. Both collect, store, and distribute thermal
              solar energy for space heating and water heating. The difference
              is that passive designs depend on natural heat and cold
              movement. Heat is naturally transferred in three ways:</p>

            <li>
              <p>Radiation is the spreading of heat through space, as in
                the radiating heat from the Sun to the Earth. Heated
                elements that send forth warmth (fireplaces and space
                room heaters) are called radiant heat sources. The
                heat waves from the Sun, called solar energy or solar
                gain, are long, strong electromagnetic waves. These
                waves are strong enough to pass through glass windows, where they refract against floors, walls,
                ceilings, furnishings, and people. As solar waves bounce
                off surfaces, some of that energy is absorbed, and the
                remainder becomes shorter, weaker wavelengths that
                cannot repenetrate the glass windows. Thus, heat is
                trapped and builds up inside glass-enclosed spaces, a
                phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Conduction is the transference of heat through matter.
                Certain materials such as glass and metal are excellent conductors, allowing heat and cold to pass
                easily
                through their molecules (which is why they are most often used as cooking utensils). Glass- and
                metal-
                framed windows conduct heat and cold into the interior; metal also makes an excellent component of
                solar
                collectors used in active solar systems and passive
                water heaters.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Convection or air movement is based on natural ther mal flow (the path of rising warm air and the
                subsequent falling of cool air). The greenhouse effect warms
                interior air, making convection work to our advantage
                through these natural thermal air flows.</p>
            </li>

            <p>When the passive system is augmented by mechanical
              devices such as pumps, fans or blowers, and ductwork—
              or even connected to an existing furnace system—it be-
              comes a hybrid solar energy system.</p>

            <h2>Green Design</h2>
          </header>
          <p>Green design is not only a major trend in building and interior design; it is also a responsibility we
            have
            to future generations. Every decision made during the building
            and systems selection process should be checked against
            whether or not the following criteria are met:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>The efficiency and long-term durability of the product. A material or mechanical system component
                that fails to perform will likely end up in the landfi ll.
                Quality counts, even if the initial cost is a little higher.
                Efficiency in utilizing natural resources is of utmost
                importance.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Materials and furnishings should come from sustainable resources, not from resources that are too
                difficult
                or take too much time to replant or regrow or that cannot be replenished.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>How efficiently the interior will function, and whether
                the lifestyle and/or working conditions within the
                building support green design. The monitoring or
                conservation of water, electricity (light and appliances), natural gas, or heating fuel is one
                example.
                Another is the ease of recycling products such as paper, cardboard, plastics, cans, and glass. Yet
                another
                efficiency factor is the ease of controlling heat and cold
                and light and dark through window coverings.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Green design does make a difference. Through attitude and commitment, each act of conservation,
                recycling, or reuse (longevity) can add to our ability to
                ensure a safe, quality life for future generations.</p>

            <h3>Life Safety</h3>
          </header>
          <p>Public buildings must include life safety systems. The
            most imminent life safety danger is fire, which can be
            potentially averted if the following system devices are in
            effect:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Smoke detectors and fire alarm systems</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Sprinkler systems to put out fires</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Automatic closing doors in case of fire</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Egress/exit lighting via light-emitting diodes that require no electricity</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Easy-to-follow directions posted in an obvious location for escape plan and stair/exit locations in
                case of fire</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Portable fire extinguishers in obvious locations</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Backup lighting and power systems for any part of a
                building that is without natural daylighting and for
                nighttime emergencies</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Systems within the Plenum</h3>
          <p>Life safety and interior comfort-control systems are
            generally located in the area known as the plenum, a
            space between the roof/ceiling and the suspended ceiling, which is a metal grid that holds acoustical
            tile.
            The
            plenum contains wiring for smoke detectors and/or fire-extinguishing sprinklers, lighting, possibly
            telephone
            and intercom (these may also be run in the floor), and
            HVAC ductwork and registers. The advantage of the
            acoustical tiles set into the grid is easy access to the plenum when maintenance is required.</p>
