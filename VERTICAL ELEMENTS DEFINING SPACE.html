      <div>
        <p>Vertical forms have a greater presence in our visual field than horizontal
          planes and are therefore more instrumental in defining a discrete volume
          of space and providing a sense of enclosure and privacy for those within it.
          In addition, they serve to separate one space from another and establish a
          common boundary between the interior and exterior environments.</p>

        <p>Vertical elements of form also play important roles in the construction
          of architectural forms and spaces. They serve as structural supports for
          floor and roof planes. They provide shelter and protection from the climatic
          elements and aid in controlling the flow of air, heat, and sound into and
          through the interior spaces of a building.</p>

        </header>
        <p>A vertical linear element, such as a column, obelisk,
          or tower, establishes a point on the ground plane and
          makes it visible in space. Standing upright and alone,
          a slender linear element is nondirectional except for
          the path that would lead us to its position in space.
          Any number of horizontal axes can be made to pass
          through it.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/form space and order/VERTICAL ELEMENTS DEFINING SPACE/vertical linear element.png"

        <p>When located within a defined volume of space,
          a column will generate a spatial field about itself
          and interact with the spatial enclosure. A column
          attached to a wall buttresses the plane and
          articulates its surface. At the corner of a space, a
          column punctuates the meeting of two wall planes.
          Standing free within a space, a column defines zones
          of space within the enclosure.</p>

            alt="VERTICAL ELEMENTS" style="height: 30%; width: 48%;">
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>When centered in a space, a column will assert itself
          as the center of the field and define equivalent
          zones of space between itself and the surrounding
          wall planes. When offset, the column will define
          hierarchical zones of space differentiated by size,
          form, and location.</p>

        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>No volume of space can be established without the
          definition of its edges and corners. Linear elements
          serve this purpose in marking the limits of spaces
          that require visual and spatial continuity with their
          surroundings.</p>

        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>Two columns establish a transparent spatial membrane
          by the visual tension between their shafts. Three or
          more columns can be arranged to define the corners of
          a volume of space. This space does not require a larger
          spatial context for its definition, but relates freely to it</p>

        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>The edges of the volume of space can be visually
          reinforced by articulating its base plane and
          establishing its upper limits with beams spanning
          between the columns or with an overhead plane. A
          repetitive series of column elements along its perimeter
          would further strengthen the definition of the volume.</p>

        <p>Four columns can establish the corners of a discrete volume of space
          within a larger room or setting. Supporting a canopy, the columns form
          an aedicule, a diminutive pavilion that serves as a shrine or the symbolic
          center of a space.</p>

        <p>Traditional Roman houses typically were organized about an atrium open
          to the sky and surrounded by a roof structure supported at the corners by
          four columns. Vitruvius termed this a tetrastyle atrium.</p>

        <p>During the Renaissance, Andrea Palladio incorporated the tetrastyle theme in
          the vestibules and halls of a number of villas and palazzi. The four columns not
          only supported the vaulted ceiling and the floor above but also adjusted the
          dimensions of the rooms to Palladian proportions.</p>

        <p>In the Sea Ranch condominium units, four posts along with a sunken floor and
          an overhead plane define an intimate aedicular space within a larger room.</p>

        <p>A regularly spaced series of columns or similar vertical elements form a colonnade. This archetypal
          element in the vocabulary of architectural design effectively defines an edge of a spatial volume while
          permitting visual and spatial continuity to exist between the space and its surroundings. A row of
          columns can also engage a wall and become a pilastrade that supports the wall, articulates its surface,
          and tempers the scale, rhythm, and proportioning of its bays.</p>

        <p>A grid of columns within a large room or hall not only serves to support the floor or roof plane above. The
          orderly rows of columns also punctuate the spatial volume, mark off modular zones within the spatial
          field, and establish a measurable rhythm and scale that make the spatial dimensions comprehensible.</p>

        <h3>VERTICAL LINEAR ELEMENTS</h3>

        <p>In 1926, Le Corbusier stated what he believed to be the "Five Points
          of the New Architecture."
          His observations were to a great extent
          the result of the development of reinforced concrete construction
          that began in the late nineteenth century.</p>


        <p>This type of construction,
          in particular the use of concrete columns to support floor and roof
          slabs, afforded new possibilities for the definition and enclosure of
          spaces within a building.</p>

        <p>Concrete slabs could cantilever beyond their column supports and
          enable the "free facade" of the building to be "light membranes"
          of "screen walls and windows." Within the building, a "free plan"
          was possible since the enclosure and layout of spaces were not
          determined or restricted by the pattern of heavy load-bearing walls.
          Interior spaces could be defined with non-load-bearing partitions, and
          their layout could respond freely to programmatic requirements.</p>

          <h3>SINGLE VERTICAL PLANE</h3>
        </header>

        <p>A single vertical plane, standing alone in space, has
          visual qualities uniquely different from those of a
          freestanding column. A round column has no preferred
          direction except for its vertical axis.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/form space and order/VERTICAL ELEMENTS DEFINING SPACE/standing alone in space.jpg"
            alt="VERTICAL ELEMENTS" style="height: 30%; width: 44%;">
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>A square column
          has two equivalent sets of faces and therefore two
          identical axes. A rectangular column also has two
          axes, but they differ in their effect. As the rectangular
          column becomes more like a wall, it can appear to be
          merely a fragment of an infinitely larger or longer plane,
          slicing through and dividing a volume of space.</p>

        <p>A vertical plane has frontal qualities. Its two surfaces
          or faces front on and establish the edges of two
          separate and distinct spatial fields.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/form space and order/VERTICAL ELEMENTS DEFINING SPACE/frontal qualities.jpg"
            alt="VERTICAL ELEMENTS" style="height: 30%; width: 44%;">
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>These two faces of a plane can be equivalent and front
          similar spaces. Or they can be differentiated in form,
          color, or texture, in order to respond to or articulate
          different spatial conditions. A vertical plane can
          therefore have either two fronts or a front and a back.</p>

        </figure> <br><br>


        <p>The field of space on which a single vertical plane fronts
          is not well-defined. The plane by itself can establish
          only a single edge of the field. To define a three-
          dimensional volume of space, the plane must interact
          with other elements of form.</p>

        <ul>
          <p>The height of a vertical plane relative to our
            body height and eye level is the critical factor
            that affects the ability of the plane to visually
            describe space.</p>

          <li>
            <p>When 2-feet high, a plane defines
              the edge of a spatial field but provides little or
              no sense of enclosure. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>hen waist-high, it begins
              to provide a sense of enclosure while allowing for
              visual continuity with the adjoining space. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>When
              it approaches our eye level in height, it begins
              to separate one space from another. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Above our
              height, a plane interrupts the visual and spatial
              continuity between two fields and provides a
              strong sense of enclosure.</p>
          </li>

          </figure> <br><br>

          <p>The surface color, texture, and pattern of a plane
            affect our perception of its visual weight, scale,
            and proportion.</p>

          </figure> <br><br>

          <p>When related to a defined volume of space, a
            vertical plane can be the primary face of the
            space and give it a specific orientation. It can
            front the space and define a plane of entry into
            it. It can be a freestanding element within a
            space and divide the volume into two separate
            but related areas.</p>

          </figure> <br><br>
        </ul>

        <p>A single vertical plane can define the principal facade of a
          building fronting a public space, establish a gateway through
          which one passes, as well as articulate spatial zones within a larger volume.</p>

              A composition of vertical planes cuts the continuous field of the
              architectural volume, creating an open plan of spaces that merge with one

        <p>An L-shaped configuration of vertical planes
          defines a field of space along a diagonal from its
          corner outward. While this field is strongly defined
          and enclosed at the corner of the configuration,
          it dissipates rapidly as it moves away from the
          corner. The introverted field at the interior corner
          becomes extroverted along its outer edges.</p>

        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>While two edges of the field are clearly defined
          by the two planes of the configuration, its
          other edges remain ambiguous unless further
          articulated by additional vertical elements,
          manipulations of the base plane, or an overhead
          plane.</p>

        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>If a void is introduced to one side of the corner of
          the configuration, the definition of the field will
          be weakened. The two planes will be isolated from
          each other and one will appear to slide by and
          visually dominate the other.</p>

        <p>A building form can have an L-shaped configuration and be
          subject to the following readings. One of the arms of the
          configuration can be a linear form that incorporates the
          corner within its boundaries while the other arm is seen
          as an appendage to it. Or the corner can be articulated
          as an independent element that joins two linear forms
          together.</p>

        <p>A building can have an L-shaped configuration to establish

        <p>L-shaped configurations of planes are stable and self-
          supporting and can stand alone in space. Because they

          They can be used in combination with one another or with
          other elements of form to define a rich variety of spaces.</p>

          <p>A common theme found in examples of residential architecture is an
            L-shaped configuration of rooms enclosing an outdoor living space. Typically,
            one wing contains the communal living spaces while the other contains
            private, individual spaces. The service and utility spaces usually occupy a
            corner position or are strung along the backside of one of the wings.</p>

          <p>The advantage of this type of layout is its provision of a private courtyard,
            sheltered by the building form and to which interior spaces can be directly
            related. In the Kingo Housing estate, a fairly high density is achieved with this
            type of unit, each with its own private outdoor space.</p>

          <p>these buildings use
            their L-shaped forms as sheltering or enclosing elements. The outdoor space
            enclosed by the architect's studio in Helsinki is used as an amphitheater
            for lectures and social occasions. It is not a passive space whose form is
            determined by the building that encloses it. Rather, it asserts its positive form
            on the shape of its enclosure. The History Faculty Building at Cambridge uses
            a seven-story, L-shaped block to functionally and symbolically enclose a large,
            roof-lit library, which is the most important space in the building.</p>

        <p>A pair of parallel vertical planes defines a field of space
          between them. The open ends of the field, established by
          the vertical edges of the planes, give the space a strong
          directional quality. Its primary orientation is along the
          axis about which the planes are symmetrical. Since the
          parallel planes do not meet to form corners and fully
          enclose the field, the space is extroverted in nature.</p>

        <p>The definition of the spatial field along the open
          ends of the configuration can be visually reinforced
          by manipulating the base plane or adding overhead
          elements to the composition.</p>

        <p>The spatial field can be expanded by extending the base
          plane beyond the open ends of the configuration. This
          expanded field can, in turn, be terminated by a vertical
          plane whose width and height is equal to that of the
          field.</p>

          axis, perpendicular to the flow of the space, will be
          established within the field. Openings in one or both of
          the planes can also introduce secondary axes to the
          field and modulate the directional quality of the space.</p>

        <p>The image of parallel vertical planes is often
          associated with the bearing-wall structural
          system, wherein a floor or roof structure spans
          the spaces between two or more parallel load-
          bearing walls.</p>

        <p>Sets of parallel vertical planes can

          <p>The flow of the space defined by parallel planes corresponds naturally to the paths of movement within a
            building, along its corridors, halls, and galleries.</p>

          <p>The parallel planes that define a circulation space can be solid and opaque to provide privacy for the
            spaces along the circulation path. The planes can also be established by a row of columns so that the
            circulation path, open on one or both of its sides, becomes part of the spaces through which it passes.</p>

          <p>The parallel vertical planes of a bearing-wall structural system can be
            the generating force behind the form and organization of a building. Their
            repetitive pattern can be modified by varying their length or by introducing
            voids within the planes to accommodate the dimensional requirements of
            larger spaces. These voids can also define circulation paths and establish
            visual relationships perpendicular to the wall planes.</p>

          <p>The slots of space defined by parallel wall planes can also be modulated by
            altering the spacing and configuration of the planes.</p>

          <p>Parallel bearing walls are often used in multifamily
            housing developments. They not only provide
            structural support for the floors and roofs of each
            housing unit, but also serve to isolate the units from
            one another, curb the passage of sound, and check
            the spread of fire. The pattern of parallel bearing
            walls is particularly appropriate for rowhousing and
            townhouse schemes where each unit is provided with
            two orientations.</p>

        </header>

        <p>A U-shaped configuration of vertical planes
          defines a field of space that has an inward
          focus as well as an outward orientation. At
          the closed end of the configuration, the field
          is well defined. Toward the open end of the
          configuration, the field becomes extroverted in
          nature.</p>

        <p>The open end is the primary aspect of the
          configuration by virtue of its uniqueness
          relative to the other three planes. It allows
          the field to have visual and spatial continuity
          with the adjoining space. The extension of the
          spatial field into the adjoining space can be
          visually reinforced by continuing the base plane
          beyond the open end of the configuration.</p>

        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>If the plane of the opening is further defined
          with columns or overhead elements, the
          definition of the original field will be reinforced
          and continuity with the adjoining space will be
          interrupted.</p>

        <p>If the configuration of planes is rectangular and
          oblong in form, the open end can be along its
          narrow or wide side. In either case, the open end
          will remain the primary face of the spatial field,
          and the plane opposite the open end will be the
          principal element among the three planes of the
          configuration.</p>

          secondary zones will be created within a multidirectional and
          dynamic field.</p>

        <p>If the field is entered through the open end of the configuration,
          the rear plane, or a form placed in front of it, will terminate our view
          of the space. If the field is entered through an opening in one of
          the planes, the view of what lies beyond the open end will draw our
          attention and terminate the sequence.</p>

        <p>If the end of a long, narrow field is open, the space will encourage
          movement and induce a progression or sequence of events. If the
          field is square, or nearly square, the space will be static and have the
          character of a place to be in, rather than a space to move through. If
          the side of a long, narrow field is open, the space will be susceptible
          to a subdivision into a number of zones.</p>

        <p>U-shaped configurations of building forms and organizations have
          the inherent ability to capture and define outdoor space. Their

          elements or can be incorporated into the body of the linear forms.</p>

            the open end of its field, it gives the field a point of focus as well as a
            greater sense of closure.</p>

          <h3>FOUR PLANES: CLOSURE</h3>
        </header>

        <p>Four vertical planes encompassing a field of space is
          probably the most typical, and certainly the strongest,
          type of spatial definition in architecture. Since the field
          is completely enclosed, its space is naturally introverted.
          To achieve visual dominance within a space or become
          its primary face, one of the enclosing planes can be
          differentiated from the others by its size, form, surface
          articulation, or by the nature of the openings within it.</p>

        <p>Well-defined, enclosed fields of space can be found in
          architecture at various scales, from a large urban square,
          to a courtyard or atrium space, to a single hall or room
          within a building complex. The examples on this and the
          following pages illustrate enclosed spatial fields in both
          urban and building-scale situations.</p>

        <p>Historically, four planes have often been used to define a
          visual and spatial field for a sacred or significant building
          that stands as an object within the enclosure. The
          enclosing planes may be ramparts, walls, or fences that
          isolate the field and exclude surrounding elements from
          the precinct.</p>

        <p>In an urban context, a defined field of space can organize a
          series of buildings along its perimeter. The enclosure may
          consist of arcades or gallery spaces that promote the
          inclusion of surrounding buildings into their domain and
          activate the space they define.</p>

          <p>The examples illustrate the use of enclosed volumes
            of space as ordering elements about which the spaces of a building can
            be clustered and organized. These organizing spaces can generally be
            characterized by their centrality, their clarity of definition, their regularity of
            form, and their dominating size. They are manifested here in the atrium spaces
            of houses, the arcaded cortile of an Italian palazzo, the enclosure of a Greek
            shrine, the courtyard of a Finnish town hall, and the cloister of a monastery.</p>

          <p>Other buildings can be seen to be dominated
            by the form of their exterior, enclosing wall planes.
            Exterior walls determine to a great extent the visual
            character of a building, whether they have the weight
            and opacity of load-bearing walls, the lightness and
            transparency of nonbearing curtain walls supported
            by a structural framework of columns and beams, or a
            combination of both.</p>

          <p>The transition from bearing-wall constructions to
            frame structures have given rise to new forms that go
            beyond the timeless elements of basic statics—the
            columns, beams, and load-bearing walls of stable
            constructions that are fixed in time and space. The
            rational forms of rectilinear geometry and the rule
            of the vertical have been revised, both statically and
            optically, by the development of irregular structures
            that rely on tension and friction rather than pressure.
            We can see these new forms as they mimic topography,
            orient themselves toward views, embrace sunlight, and
            turn away from cold winds and stormy weather.</p>

          <p>The evolution of materials and technology for separating the skin of a building from its
            structure has also played a major role in the development of building forms.</p>

          <p>Structural glass facades integrate structure and cladding to provide maximum
            transparency in buildings. While their forms may vary, the translucent panels typically span
            from floor to floor and are supported by structural systems that are exposed and distinct
            from the building's primary structure.</p>

          <p>Many of the structural systems use trusses or trussed supports, which may slope inward
            or outward, or follow a curved geometry in plan or section. Some use glass fines set
            perpendicular to the glass facade to provide lateral support.</p>

          <p>Gridshells are form-active structures that derive their strength from their double-curved
            surface geometry. The system uses a network of in-plane prestressed cables to provide
            stability and shear resistance to the thin shell grid. Vaulted, domed, and other double-
            curved configurations can be used in vertical and overhead applications as well as to form
            complete building enclosures.</p>

          <p>Diagrid structures refer to networks of intersecting members connected at
            specially jointed nodes to create a diagonal grid across a building surface.
            The diagonal members are capable of carrying both gravity and lateral loads
            through triangulation, which results in a relatively uniform load distribution. </p>

          <p>This exoskeletal framework allows for the possible reduction in the number of
            internal supports, saving on space and building materials and providing for
            greater flexibility in interior layouts. Also, because each diagonal can be viewed
            as providing a continuous load path to the ground, the number of possible
            load paths in case of a localized structural failure results in a high degree of
            redundancy.</p>

                  diagrid, the concrete diagrid used in TOD's Omotesando Building is based
                  on a pattern of overlapping tree silhouettes that mimic the branch
                  structure of nearby elm trees. Similar to the growth pattern of trees, the
                  diagrid members get thinner and more numerous with a higher ratio of
                  openings as you move up higher in the building.</b></p>

          <p>The various forms of diagram structures have been made possible
            through digital technologies that help us to conceive of and make
            visible complex three-dimensional constructions and compositions.
            3D modeling and CAD software enable us to develop, describe, and
            fabricate the components to realize these constructions. Many of
            these creations would be difficult, if not impossible, to do by hand.
            This is especially true of the calculations necessary to determine
            the structural requirements for the individual members of a diagrid
            system. </p>

          <p>3D modeling and CAD software have not only the computational
            capability to calculate the structural requirements for each member
            but also the means with 3D printers to fabricate the components,
            many of which are not identical for assembly on site.</p>

          <p>Perimeter hoops resist the horizontal forces at each node level where
            the diagonal columns intersect. As with dome structures, the hoops
            in the upper region are in compression while those at the middle and
            lower levels are subject to significant tensile forces. The hoops also
            serve to transform the diagrid into a very stiff triangulated shell,
            freeing the interior core from the need to resist lateral wind forces.</p>

                  the tower was partially influenced by the need to have a smooth flow of wind
