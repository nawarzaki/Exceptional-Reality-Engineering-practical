          <h2>Interior Design Styles</h2>
        </header>

        <div>
          <p>The established styles of interior design form the basis for making decisions for a personal interior
            design style. Following are general styles and descriptions of well-known interior design styles:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Authentic historic or period styles developed in specific geographic areas or countries during a
                definite developmental or political period with a unity of style in exterior and interior
                architecture,
                furniture, wall and floor coverings, window and bed treatments, lighting and accessory styles, and
                color
                palette.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Formal Traditional takes components from formal European and American historic design: the
                Renaissance
                and Baroque, Early and Late Georgian, French Rococo, Neoclassic/Federal, Greek Revival/American
                Empire,
                and Victorian. The look is elegant, with re-fined materials, textures, and patterns, and compatible,
                blended furnishings of historic significance that are comfortable for today's lifestyles.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Informal Traditional, Colonial, or American Country is a less refined style with a handcrafted
                charm
                from the Medieval English Elizabethan period, Colonial America, and regional American furnishings
                with a
                focus on the original colonies of the East Coast.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Informal European style comes from three areas with common backgrounds and similar furnishings.
                These
                are Country or Provincial France, Tuscany, Italy, and Colonial Spain, which spread throughout the
                Americas.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Casual Contemporary is a look of relaxed comfort, with handsome furnishings and low-maintenance
                materials. This style varies according to geographic and regional influences. It may use wicker or
                natural wood, durable materials and sturdy but comfortable fabrics combined in an easy-living style
                with
                personally meaningful accessories.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Asian or Oriental styles are primarily from China and Japan. See Chapter 15. Today these styles may
                be
                indicated as art or accents.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                International Modern originated in Europe and spread to the United States as a contract and
                residential
                style. It is a stark, clean style with expansive windows, plain plaster walls, hard natural and
                man-made
                materials and filled with the sculptural modern furniture classics
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Organic Modern is a style by Frank Lloyd Wright, whose Prairie Style seemed to grow from the ground,
                harmonious with its setting. It also includes the Crafts-man style with its Arts and Crafts
                Interiors, a
                product of the Greene Brothers as architects, Gustav Stickley as furniture designer, and William
                Morris
                as textile surface designer
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Scandinavian Modern is a blend of International and Organic styles as interpreted by Scandinavian
                and
                American architects and designers. Large windows and sliding glass doors open to nature. Interiors
                have
                wood ceilings and, often, floors, and rooms are furnished sparsely with midcentury Scandinavian
                Modern
                furniture.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Retro Modern is a nostalgic contemporary inter-play of International, Organic, and/or Scandinavian
                Modern styles blended with midcentury American culture.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Contemporary Organic is a style of open cleanliness with generous use of wood on floors, walls, and
                ceilings as vertical or horizontal planks, paneling, or logs. This style uses a variety of window
                styles
                and furnishings from Colonial to Modern. It is popular in waterfront or nature-based homes.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Influences of Art Nouveau and Art Deco may be seen as unique pieces in many of the above interiors.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Eclectic design uses furnishings from different styles and periods in a cohesive, interesting,
                unique,
                and artistic composition. Each piece should have merit and stand on its own in terms of excellent
                design. Eclectic interiors often reflect the travels, interests, and values of its owner and require
                artistic sensitivity and sound judgment for success.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Thematic interior design is contemporary or current de-sign based on a theme. The sources for themes
                are
                varied and nearly limitless. Examples include culture/country-style themes, sports, nature, pop
                culture,
                fashion, juvenile themes, space exploration, movies, or fantasy character themes. Some themes will
                be
                temporary, and as a child grows or an interest or hobby wanes, the need for refurnishing is more
                frequent, making theme-based interior design less sustainable and responsible than long-lived design
                that can adapt to changes in demographics.
              </p>
