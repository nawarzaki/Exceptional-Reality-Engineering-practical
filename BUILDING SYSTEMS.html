          <h2>Water Supply Systems</h2>
        </header>

        <p>Water supply systems operate under pressure. The
          service pressure of a water supply system must
          be great enough to absorb pressure losses due
          to vertical travel and friction as the water flows
          through pipes and fittings, and still satisfy the
          pressure requirement of each plumbing fixture. </p>

        <p>Public water systems usually supply water at
          about 50 psi (345 kPa), which is sufficient for
          upfeed distribution in low-rise buildings up to six
          stories in height. For taller buildings, or where the
          water service pressure is insufficient to maintain
          adequate fixture service, water is pumped up to
          an elevated or rooftop storage tank for gravity
          downfeed. Part of this water is often used as a
          reserve for fire-protection systems.</p>

        <ul>
          <p>The pressurized water supply side of the plumbing
            system results in smaller piping and more flexible
            distribution layouts. The water supply lines can
            usually be accommodated within floor and wall
            construction spaces without too much difficulty. It
            should be coordinated with the building structure
            and other systems, such as the parallel but bulkier
            sanitary drainage system. Water supply pipes
            should be supported at every story vertically and
            every 6 to 10 feet (1830 to 3050) horizontally.
            Adjustable hangers can be used to ensure proper
            pitch along horizontal runs for drainage.</p>

            <p>Water heaters are electric or gas appliances for

              dispersed hot-water storage tanks may be
              required for large installations and widespread
              fixture groupings. Alternatively, in-line,
              on-demand water heaters that heat water at
              the time and point of use may be used. </p>

            <p>These
              systems alleviate the need for a storage tank
              but will require a flue if they burn fuel. Solar
              heating is also a possibility, either as a primary
              source of hot water in sunny climates or as a
              preheating system backed up by a standard

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>ot-water pipes should be insulated
              against heat loss and should be no

          <h2>Sanitary Sewage Systems </h2>
        </header>

        <p>The water supply system terminates at each
          plumbing fixture. After water has been drawn
          and used, it enters the sanitary sewage system.
          The primary objective of this drainage system is
          to dispose of fluid waste and organic matter as
          quickly as possible.</p>

        <p>Because a sanitary drainage
          system relies on gravity for its discharge, its pipes
          are much larger than the water supply lines,
          which are under pressure. Sanitary drain lines are
          sized according to their location in the system and
          the total number and types of fixtures served.</p>

        <p>The layout of the sanitary drainage system should
          be as direct and straightforward as possible
          to prevent the deposit of solids and clogging.
          Cleanouts should be located to allow pipes to be
          easily cleaned if they do clog.</p>

        <h3>Storm Drain Systems</h3>
        <p>The storm drain system conveys rainfall drained
          from roofs and paved surfaces as well as the
          outfall from the building foundation to the
          municipal storm drain or to holding ponds or
          tanks for irrigation use. Storm drains, like sanitary
          drains, have a prescribed slope to ensure proper
          drainage.</p>

          <h2>Fire Protection Systems</h2>
        </header>

        <p>In large commercial and institutional buildings where
          public safety is an issue, building codes often require
          a fire sprinkler system to extinguish a fire before it can
          spread out of control; some codes allow an increase in
          floor area if an approved sprinkler system is installed.
          Some jurisdictions require the installation of fire sprinkler
          systems in multifamily housing as well.</p>

        <p>Fire sprinkler systems consist of pipes that are located in
          or below ceilings, connected to a suitable water supply,
          and supplied with valves or sprinkler heads made to
          open automatically at a certain temperature. Specific
          requirements for the use and location of the sprinkler
          heads make the planning and coordination of the system a
          priority in the design of ceilings and underfloor cavities.</p>

        <ul>
          <p>The two major types of sprinkler systems are wet-pipe
            systems and dry-pipe systems.</p>

          <li>
            <h3>Wet-pipe systems</h3>
            <p>Wet-pipe systems contain water at sufficient pressure
              to provide an immediate, continuous discharge through
              sprinkler heads that open automatically in the event of a
              fire.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Dry-pipe systems</h3>
            <p>Dry-pipe systems contain pressurized air that is released
              when a sprinkler head opens in the event of fire,
              allowing water to flow through the piping and out the
              opened nozzle. Dry-pipe systems are used where the
              piping is subject to freezing.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Preaction systems are dry-pipe sprinkler systems
              through which water flow is controlled by a valve
              operated by fire-detection devices more sensitive than
              those in the sprinkler heads. Preaction systems are used
              when an accidental discharge would damage valuable
              materials.</p>


          <li>
            <p>Deluge systems have sprinkler heads open at all times,
              through which water flow is controlled by a valve
              operated by a heat-, smoke-, or flame-sensing device.</p>

            <p>Sprinkler heads are nozzles for
              dispersing a stream or spray of
              water, usually controlled by a fusible
              link that melts at a predetermined
              temperature.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Standpipes are water pipes
              extending vertically through a
              building to supply fire hoses at every
              floor.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Dry standpipes contain air that is
              displaced by water when they are
              put to use; wet standpipe systems
              contain water at all times.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Class I systems provide large 2 1/2"-
              (64-) diameter hose connections for
              use by firefighters trained in the use
              of the heavy flow these connections
              provide.</p>

        <ul>
          <p>Utility companies transmit electrical power at high
            voltage to minimize voltage drop and conductor size in the
            transmission systems. For safety, transformers step this
            voltage down to lower voltages at the point of use. There
            are three different electrical system voltages commonly
            used in buildings:</p>

          <li>
            <p>120/240-volt, single-phase electrical power is typical
              for smaller-scale buildings and almost all residences.
              The utility owns and maintains transformers that
              provide 120/240-volt power from the high-voltage
              distribution line. The building requires only a meter,
              main disconnect, and distribution panel.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>120/208-volt, three-phase electrical power is used in
              medium-sized buildings for the efficient operation of
              large motors used for fans, elevators, escalators; 120-
              volt power is provided as well for lighting and outlets.
              Such facilities would have a dry transformer to step
              down a high-supply voltage, located either outside of
              the building or inside as a unit substation.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>277/480-volt, three-phase electrical power is used in
              large commercial buildings that will purchase their
              power at high voltage. These buildings require a large
              transformer along with a transformer vault. In addition
              there will be a separate switchboard room to partition
              the power to major users. Large motors in the building
              will use three-phase power while fluorescent lighting
              will use 277-volt, single-phase power. Electric closets
              will typically be required throughout the building,
              typically on each floor, to house smaller dry transformers
              to produce 120-volt, single-phase power for electrical
              outlets.</p>
          </li>

          <p>The electrical system of a building supplies power for
            lighting, heating, and the operation of electrical equipment
            and appliances. Generator sets may be required to
            supply emergency electrical power for exit lighting, alarm
            systems, elevators, telephone systems, fire pumps, and
            medical equipment in hospitals.</p>

          <p>The service connection may be overhead or underground.
            Overhead service is less expensive, easily accessible for
            maintenance, and can carry high voltages over long runs.
            Underground service is more expensive but is used in high-
            load-density situations such as urban areas. The service
            cables are run in pipe conduit or raceways for protection
            and to allow for future replacement. Direct burial cable
            may be used for residential service connections.</p>

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The service drop is the overhead portion of
              service conductors extending from the nearest
              utility pole to a building. The service lateral is
              the underground equivalent extending from a

              utility, it is always placed ahead of the
              main disconnect switch so that it cannot
              be disconnected; for multiple-occupancy
              buildings, banks of meters are installed so that
              each unit can be metered independently.</p>

            <p>Transformers step down a high-supply voltage
              to the service voltage of medium-sized and
              large buildings. To reduce costs, maintenance,
              and noise and heat problems, a transformer
              may be placed on an outdoor pad. If located
              within a building, oil-filled transformers
              require a well-ventilated, fire-rated vault with
              two exits and located on an exterior wall
              adjacent to the switchgear room. Dry-type
              transformers used in small- and medium-
              sized buildings may be placed together with
              a disconnect switch and switchgear in a unit

              metering instruments, and busbars for
              controlling, distributing, and protecting a
              number of electric circuits. It should be located
              as close as possible to the service connection
              to minimize voltage drop and for wiring
              economy.</p>

              load ends of circuits. In residences and small

            <p>Circuit breakers are switches that

            <p>Low-voltage circuits carry alternating
              current below 50 volts, supplied by a
              step-down transformer from the normal
              line voltage. These circuits are used in
              residential systems to control doorbells,
              intercoms, heating and cooling systems,
              and remote lighting fixtures. Low-voltage
              wiring does not require a protective
              raceway.</p>
          </li>
          <br>

          <h3>Electrical Circuits</h3>

          <p>Once the electrical power requirements for the various
            areas of a building are determined, wiring circuits must
            be laid out to distribute the power to the points of use.
            Separate wiring circuits are required for the sound and
            signal equipment of telephone, cable, intercom, and
            security or fire alarm systems.</p>

          <br>

          <h3>Electrical Wiring</h3>

          <p>Conduit provides support for wires and cables and protects
            them against physical damage and corrosion. Metal
            conduit also provides a continuous grounded enclosure for
            the wiring. For fireproof construction, rigid metal conduit,
            electrical metallic tubing, or flexible metal conduit can
            be used. For frame construction, armored or nonmetallic
            sheathed cable is used. Plastic tubing and conduits are
            most commonly used for underground wiring.</p>

          <p>Being relatively small, conduit can be easily
            accommodated in most construction systems. Conduit
            should be adequately supported and laid out as directly as
            possible. Codes generally restrict the radius and number
            of bends a run of conduit may have between junction or
            outlet boxes. Coordination with a building's mechanical
            and plumbing systems is required to avoid conflicting
            paths.</p>

          <p>Electrical conductors are often run within the raceways of
            cellular steel decking to allow for the flexible placement
            of power, signal, and telephone outlets in office buildings.
            Flat conductor cable systems are also available for
            installation directly under carpet tiles.</p>

          <p>For exposed installations, special conduit, raceways,
            troughs, and fittings are available. As with exposed
            mechanical systems, the layout should be visually
            coordinated with the physical elements of the space.</p>

        <ul>
          <p>In air-water systems, the air treatment and refrigeration
            source may be separated from the served spaces.
            However, the temperature of the air delivered to the
            conditioned spaces is primarily balanced by warm or cool
            water circulated in an induction unit or radiant panel in the
            conditioned spaces. Air may be returned to the central unit
            or exhausted directly. Common types of air-water systems
            include:</p>

          <li>
            <p> Induction systems use high-velocity ducts to supply
              conditioned primary air from a central plant to each
              zone or space, where it mixes with room air and is
              further heated or cooled in induction units. The primary
              air draws in room air through a filter and the mixture
              passes over coils that are heated or chilled by secondary
              water piped from a boiler or chilled-water plant. Local
              thermostats control water flow over the coils to regulate
              air temperature.</p>

            <h3>Plumbing Chases</h3>
          </header>

          <p>Plumbing chases provide the space necessary for the
            water supply and sanitary sewage lines in a building. They
            are almost invariably associated with lavatories, kitchens,
            and laboratories. Potential conflicts between a building
            structure and plumbing lines can be avoided by restricting
            supply and drainage piping to vertical plumbing chases.</p>

          <li>
            <p>For reasons of economy and access, it is desirable to
              arrange the plumbing waste and vent stacks in a vertical
              chase extending through all of the floors of multistory
              buildings.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Locating rooms that require plumbing above one another
              with the fixtures backed up to a common plumbing wall
              or chase creates room for the waste and vent stacks
              and for the plumbing runs that often must cross the
              stacks horizontally.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Plumbing chases provide easier access for maintenance</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Plumbing or wet walls behind fixtures should be deep
              enough to accommodate branch lines, fixture runouts,
              and air chambers.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>12" (305) wide for single-loaded plumbing walls</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>18" (455) wide for double-loaded plumbing walls</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Horizontal sanitary sewage and stormwater lines must
              be sloped to drain and thus have priority in the planning
              of the horizontal mechanical space.</p>
          </li>

          <p>Although the use of plumbing chases is less critical in
            low-rise buildings, it is a particularly efficient approach
            to organizing and laying out the plumbing systems of
            certain building types, such as high-rise structures, hotels,
            hospitals, and dormitories.</p>

          <h3>Fan Rooms</h3>
        </header>

        <ul>
          <p>While it is more efficient to locate a fan room in a central
            location to reduce the length of air supply ducts, it may be
            located anywhere in a building that provides an outside
            air source and exhaust, and from which vertical shafts can
            accommodate the necessary supply and return air ducts.</p>

          <li>
            <p>In large buildings, it may be economical to use multiple
              fan rooms for different zones of service. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Air handlers are limited in forcing air up or down
              through a maximum of 10 to 15 floors. In taller buildings,
              multiple fan rooms are required, resulting in mechanical
              floors spaced 20 to 30 floors apart. Some tall buildings
              eliminate the need for vertical shafts by locating a fan
              room on each floor.</p>
          </li>

        </ul> <br><br>

        <header>
          <h3>Cores</h3>
        </header>

        <p>In buildings two to three stories high, vertical chases for
          mechanical services are often located wherever they
          can be accommodated within the floor plans and provide
          service where it is needed. Without careful planning,
          this can result in weaving ductwork, piping, and wiring
          in and around the building structure, making access for
          maintenance or alterations difficult and reducing the
          efficiency of the systems.</p>

        <p>In large and tall buildings, mechanical chases are often
          located with other shafts, such as those enclosing exit
          stairways, elevators, and plumbing risers. This naturally
          leads to the grouping of these facilities into one or more
          efficient cores that extend vertically through the height of
          the building. Because these cores are continuous as they
          rise through multiple floors—and additional fire protection
          is required in their construction—they can also serve as
          shear walls to help resist lateral loads as well as bearing
          walls to assist in carrying gravity loads.</p>

          <h3>Core Locations</h3>
        </header>

        <p>The service core or cores of a building house the vertical
          distribution of mechanical and electrical services,
          elevator shafts, and exit stairways. These cores must be
          coordinated with the structural layout of columns, bearing
          walls, and shear walls or lateral bracing as well as with
          the desired patterns of space, use, and activity.</p>

        <h3>Horizontal Distribution of Mechanical Services</h3>

        <p>Mechanical services are distributed to and from vertical
          shafts and chases in a horizontal manner through the
          floor-ceiling assemblies of a building. The manner in
          which these services relate to the depth of the structural
          spanning system determines the vertical extent of the
          floor-ceiling assemblies, which in turn has a significant
          effect on the overall height of a building.</p>

        <ul>
          <p>There are three fundamental ways in which to distribute
            the horizontal runs of mechanical services:</p>

          <li>
            <p>Above the spanning structure</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Through the spanning structure</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Below the spanning structure</p>
          </li>

          <br><br>

          <li>
            <p>Above-floor distribution of mechanical services
              is desirable when a high degree of access and
              flexibility of layout is required and when the
              underside of the spanning structure is to be left
              exposed as a finish ceiling.</p>

          <li>
            <p>Through-floor distribution of mechanical services
              is appropriate when the spanning elements are
              deep and incorporate openings large enough for the
              passage of ducts and piping.</p>

          <li>
            <p>Below-floor distribution of mechanical services
              concealed by a suspended ceiling is the most
              common type of installation. To minimize the depth
              of the floor-ceiling assembly, below-floor distribution
              systems should be used with relatively shallow
              spanning structures, such as flat slabs and plates.</p>

          <p>Wiring and supply pipes require little space and can
            readily be run in small chases and floor or ceiling cavities.
            Distributing air, however, requires supply and return ducts
            of significant size. This is particularly true of systems
            where reduced noise is important and air is supplied at
            a low velocity, or where a small differential between a
            desired temperature and that of the supplied air requires
            a high volume of air movement. HVAC systems, therefore,
            pose the greatest potential conflict with both the horizontal
            and vertical dimensions of a building structure.</p>


          <li>
            <p>Running trunk lines and major ducts in
              corridors or other spaces that can tolerate
              lower ceilings helps minimize conflicts
              between a structural system and the
              horizontal distribution of air ducts for
              HVAC systems.</p>

          <p>The horizontal distribution of mechanical services through
            a spanning structure is made possible by the openings
            inherent in certain structural elements, such as steel
            and wood trusses, light-gauge steel joists, hollow-core
            concrete planks, cellular steel decking, and wood I-joists.</p>

          <li>
            <p>Running air ducts within the depth of a spanning
              structure will constrain their maximum size. For
              example, the maximum diameter of an air duct
              passing through a series of open-web joists is
              one-half the joist depth.</p>

            <p>Running air ducts through floor trusses or in the space

            <p>The girders and beams of steel and timber structures

              than stringerless systems; seismic pedestals are
              available to meet building code requirements for lateral
              stability.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Design loads range from 250 to 625 psf (12 to
              30 kPa), but are available up to 1125 psf (54 kPa) to
              accommodate heavier loadings.</p>

          <li>
            <p>The underfloor space is used for the installation of
              electrical conduit, junction boxes, and the cables for
              computer, security, and communication systems.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> It may still be necessary for sprinkler systems, power
              for lighting, and air-handling equipment to penetrate the
              spanning structural floors.</p>

          <li>
            <p>The space can also be used as a plenum to distribute
              the supply air of the HVAC system, allowing the ceiling
              plenum to be used only for return air. Separating cool
              supply air from warmer return air in this manner can
              reduce energy consumption. Lowering the overall height
              of service plenums also reduces the floor-to-floor height
              of new construction.</p>
