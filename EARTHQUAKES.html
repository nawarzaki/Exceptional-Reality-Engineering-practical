        <h1>EARTHQUAKES</h1>
      </header>

      <p>An earthquake consists of a series of longitudinal and
        transverse vibrations induced in the earth's crust by the
        abrupt movement of plates along fault lines. The shocks of
        an earthquake propagate along the earth's surface in the
        form of waves and attenuate logarithmically with distance
        from its source. While these ground motions are three-
        dimensional in nature, their horizontal components are
        considered to be the more critical in structural design; the
        vertical load-carrying elements of a structure usually have
        considerable reserve for resisting additional vertical loads.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p> P-waves: Primary or compression waves travel in the
            direction they are propagating.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>S-waves: Secondary or shear waves travel more slowly
            than P-waves and shake in a transverse direction.</p>
        </li>

        <br><br>


        <p>How a building responds to seismic loading depends on:</p>

        <li>
          <p>the magnitude, duration, and harmonic character of the
            ground motions;</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>the size, configuration, and stiffness of the structure; </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>the type and characteristics of the ground material
            supporting the structure.</p>

        <p>All structures require lateral-force-resisting and vertical-
          force-resisting systems having adequate strength,
          stiffness, and energy dissipation capacity to withstand the
          anticipated earthquake-induced ground motions.</p>

        <h2>EARTHQUAKES</h2>
      </header>

      <ul>
        <p>The overall tendency of a building subjected to an
          earthquake is to vibrate as the ground shakes. Seismically
          induced shaking affects a building in three primary ways:
          inertial force, overturning, and fundamental period of
          vibration.</p>

        <li>
          <h3>Inertial Force</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>The first response of a building during an earthquake is
                to not move at all due to the inertia of its mass. Almost
                instantaneously, however, the ground acceleration
                causes the building to move at the base, inducing a
                lateral load on the building and a shear force at the
                base (seismic base shear). The inertial force in the
                building opposes the base shear but both forces reverse
                directions as the building vibrates back and forth.</p>
            </li>

            <figure>
              <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/Lateral Stability/EARTHQUAKES 1.png" alt="Lateral Stability"
                style="height: 24%; width: 42%;">
              <figcaption>
                <p><b>EARTHQUAKES</b></p>
              </figcaption>
            </figure><br><br>

            <li>
              <p>From Newton's second law, the inertial force is equal to
                the product of mass and acceleration.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p> Inertial forces can be lessened by reducing the
                building's mass. Therefore, lightweight construction
                is advantageous in seismic design. Light buildings,
                such as wood-frame houses, generally perform well
                in earthquakes, while heavy masonry structures are
                susceptible to significant damage.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Seismic base shear is the minimum design value for the
                total lateral seismic force on a structure assumed to act
                in any horizontal direction.</p>
            </li>

                <p><b>The seismic base shear for a building
                    is distributed along its height to each

                    with a zero value at the base and the
                    maximum value near the top.</b></p>
              </figcaption>
            </figure><br><br>

            <li>
              <p>For regular structures, low irregular structures, and
                structures at low seismic risk, seismic base shear
                is computed by multiplying the total dead load of
                the structure by a number of coefficients to reflect
                the character and intensity of the ground motions in
                the seismic zone, the soil profile type underlying the
                foundation, the type of occupancy, the distribution
                of the mass and stiffness of the structure, and the
                fundamental period—the time required for one
                complete oscillation—of the structure.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>A more complex dynamic analysis is required for high-
                rise structures, structures with irregular shapes or
                framing systems, or for structures built on soft or plastic
                soils susceptible to failure or collapse under seismic
                loading.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Engineers and designers who
                have studied the performance of
                buildings in earthquakes conclude
                that a building's configuration and
                proportions have a major influence
                on how seismic forces work their
                way through the structure to its
                foundation. The ideal building
                configuration for resisting earthquake
                forces is a symmetrical form in
                both plan and elevation.</p>

          </ul>

        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Overturning Moment</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Any lateral load applied at a distance above grade
                generates an overturning moment at the base of a
                structure. For equilibrium, the overturning moment must
                be counterbalanced by an external restoring moment
                and an internal resisting moment provided by forces
                developed in column members and shear walls.</p>
            </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Fundamental Period of Vibration</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>The natural or fundamental period of a structure (T) varies
                according to its height above the base and its dimension
                parallel to the direction of applied forces. Relatively stiff
                structures oscillate rapidly and have short periods while
                more flexible structures oscillate more slowly and have
                longer periods.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>As seismic vibrations propagate through the ground
                material underlying a building structure, they may
                be either amplified or attenuated, depending on the
                fundamental period of the material. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The fundamental
                period of ground material varies from approximately 0.40
                seconds for hard soil or rock up to 1.5 seconds for soft
                soil. Very soft soil may have periods of up to 2 seconds.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Earthquake shaking tends to be greater in a building
                situated on soft ground than in one built over hard
                ground. If the soil's period falls within the range of the
                building's period, it is possible for this correspondence to
                create a condition of resonance.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Any amplification in building vibration is undesirable. A
                structural design should ensure that the building period
                does not coincide with the period of the supporting soil.
                Short, stiff (short-period) buildings sited on soft (long-
                period) ground would be appropriate as well as tall
                buildings (long-period) built on hard, stiff (short-period)
                soil.</p>

        <p>Damping, ductility, and strength-stiffness are three
          characteristics that can help a structure resist and
          dissipate the effects of seismically-induced motion.</p>

        <li>

          <h3>Damping</h3>

          <p>Damping refers to any of several means of absorbing or
            dissipating energy to progressively diminish successive
            oscillations or waves of a vibrating structure. </p>

          <p>In addition to these damping methods, a building's
            non-structural elements, connections, construction
            materials, and design assumptions can provide damping
            characteristics that greatly reduce the magnitude of the
            building's vibration or swaying during an earthquake.</p>

        </li>

        </figure><br><br>

        <li>

          <h3>Ductility</h3>

          <p>Ductility is the ability of a structural member to deform
            several times the design deformation at its flexural yield
            capacity, which allows excessive loads to be distributed
            to other structural members or to other parts of the
            same member. </p>

          <p>Ductility is an important source of reserve
            strength in buildings that allow materials like steel to
            distort considerably without breaking, and in doing so, to
            dissipate the energy of the earthquake.</p>

          <h3>Strength & Stiffness</h3>

          <p>Strength is the ability of a structural member to resist
            a given load without exceeding the safe stress of the
            material. Stiffness, on the other hand, is a measure of
            the structural member's ability to control deformation and
            limit the amount of its movement under loading.</p>

          <p>Limiting
            movement in this way helps to minimize the detrimental
            effects on the non-structural components of a building,
            such as cladding, partitions, hung ceilings and furnishings,
            as well as on the comfort of the building's occupants.</p>

        <h2>LATERAL-FORCE-RESISTING MECHANISMS</h2>
      </header>
      <ul>
        <p>In general, there are three basic mechanisms commonly
          used, alone or in combination, for assuring the lateral
          stability of a building. They are: </p>

        <li>
          <p>Braced frames</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Moment frames</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Shear walls</p>
        </li>

        <p>Note that all of these lateral-
          force-resisting mechanisms are only effective against
          in-plane lateral forces. They cannot be expected to resist
          lateral forces perpendicular to their planes.</p>

        <p>The primary horizontal mechanism
          used to distribute lateral forces to
          vertical resisting elements is the
          diaphragm.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Diaphragms are rigid floor and roof
              assemblies capable of transferring
              lateral forces to vertical resisting
              elements.</p>

        </header>

        <p>Eccentrically braced frames combine the strength and
          stiffness of braced frames with the inelastic (plastic)
          behavior and energy dissipation characteristic of moment
          frames. They incorporate diagonal braces that connect at
          separate points to beam or girder members, forming short
          link-beams between the braces and column members
          or between two opposing braces. The link-beams act
          as fuses to limit large forces from being exerted on and
          overstressing other elements in the frame.</p>

        <p>The expected magnitude of seismic loads and the
          conservative nature of building codes make it necessary
          to assume some yielding of a structure during large
          earthquakes. However, in zones of high seismic risk, such
          as California, designing a building to remain entirely elastic
          during a large earthquake would be cost-prohibitive. </p>

        <p>Because steel frames have the ductility to dissipate large
          amounts of seismic energy and maintain stability even
          under large inelastic deformations, eccentrically braced
          steel frames are commonly used in seismic regions.
          They also provide the necessary stiffness to reduce drift
          produced by wind loads.</p>

        </header>

        <p>The amount of lateral bracing provided in multi-bay
          arrangements is a function of the lateral forces present;
          not all bays of a multi-bay arrangement need necessarily
          be braced.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>A general rule-of-thumb is to brace every third or fourth
              bay as a minimum.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>An interior bay can be laterally braced to provide
              stability for the other bays.</p>
          </li>

          </figure><br><br>

          <li>
            <p>As more bays are braced, the member sizes of the
              bracing decrease and the lateral stiffness of the frame
              improves, resulting in less lateral displacement.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Two internal bays can be braced to provide the exterior
              bays with lateral stability.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The beam member of the multi-bay frame need not be
              continuous. For example, these pin connections would
              not adversely affect the lateral stability of the frame.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Two exterior bays can be braced to provide an
              interior, column-free bay with lateral stability. The two
              overhanging beams support a simple beam.</p>
          </li>

          </figure><br><br>

          <li>
            <p>When the bay proportions would cause a single
              diagonal brace to be too steep or too flat, consider other
              forms of bracing to ensure effective bracing action.</p>
          </li>

          </figure><br><br>

          <li>
            <p>While not every bay in a single story need be braced, it
              is critical that all levels in multistory buildings be braced.
              In this case, the diagonally braced bays act as a vertical
              truss.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Note that in each of these illustrations, moment frames
              or shear walls may also be used in place of the braced
              frames shown.</p>
