          <h2>Training the Eye</h2>
        </header>
        <p>An eye for great design comes from consciously observing and comparing. Here are some places and ways to
          develop the power of discernment:</p>

        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Visit public buildings such as museums and art galleries, great public and church architecture, quality
                furniture stores and boutiques. These and other well-designed contract places broaden our exposure to
                varying styles and can lead to discernment.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Walk through residential interiors owned by family and friends; go to showcase homes and model homes.
                Visit historic homes open to the public or museum homes. These exposures help in judging what works
                aesthetically and what is poorly designed by comparing furnishings and considering how other people
                function and interact in the spaces.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Analyze the media, which include design periodicals (interior design magazines), movie and video stage
                sets, CAD programs, and Internet sites. The media play an important role in shaping both short-lived
                fads and longer-lived trends. Much of what we see in the media is fair or good design, some is
                excellent, and some is poor to bad design. Don't be easily persuaded just because it's in a magazine or
                on the screen. Some “in-style” interiors have merit; others do not. It is just fi ne to let a fad pass
                by. Good design will stand the test of time. Don't be in a hurry to copy what you see. Take a little
                time to consider the merits of the design direction.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Observe nature. It has been said that nature never makes an aesthetic mistake, and examples of nature's
                infallibility are all around us to study and learn from. The majesty we see in nature developed over a
                very long time. The result—a patina or mellow, warm, old beauty—is something that we can seek to create
                in our own interiors. As with nature, we need feel no rush to “complete” an interior. Our lives, like
                nature, evolve and never stagnate. Demographics change, careers change, possessions change. Let the
                process be part of the beauty, rather than thinking an interior should be “done.” Great interiors, like
                nature, change and reflect the growth of those who live there.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Seek education in the form of book and media learning, classroom instruction, and hands-on projects.
                Interior design is a complex field that involves many disciplines. A wide range of technical information
                and the creative capacity to solve problems often come from intense training, exposure, and seasoned
                experience. The study of historic styles yields a healthy perspective. Recognizing the designs that have
                withstood the test of time and are still considered beautiful cultivates appreciation and a love for
                fine design.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

        <div id="Finding_a_Personal_Style">
          <header>
            <h2>Finding a Personal Style</h2>
          </header>
          <p>Just as no two people are the same, so no two interiors should be alike. Finding ideas that appeal to you
            can certainly serve as a source of inspiration, but copying others' styles will not help you develop a style
            of your own. </p>

          <ul>
            <p>Consider these suggestions:</p>
            <li>
              <p>
                Pare back before piling on extras. Sorting through personal possessions and giving away things that are
                no longer useful or sentimental is a great starting point. Live with bare walls for a while—there is no
                shame in this. Then consider, ponder, observe, and live in the space before beginning to furnish.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Rearrange what you already have before planning new purchases. Often the perceived need to own new
                things is folly. Good interior design rarely results from throwing out everything and starting from
                scratch with new furnishings. Rather, give new life by moving things around, rotating art and
                accessories, and moving furniture to different locations or different rooms.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Think “need,” not “want.” Give serious thought to how you want to live and what you want to do in an
                interior. The space should first of all meet the functional needs of the occupants. Think “What do I
                need?” rather than “What do I want?” The ensuing solution will make the most sense. The design program
                discussed in Chapter 1 should spell this out well. Remember, the more data that are gathered, the better
                the design solution.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Simplify and organize. Cluttered, messy, or dirty rooms are not good design, no matter how costly the
                furnishings. Neat and clean, well-organized spaces bring peace, contentment, and harmony to the lives of
                those who live and work there. The dependable adage “A place for everything and everything in its place”
                serves well in developing a personal style. Things not in use should be put away in containers or boxes,
                carefully labeled. Things not used in a year's time could be sold or given away. According to the
                National Association of Professional Organizers (NAPO), organized people save time and money, and reduce
                their stress and frustration levels. This means they can find what is needed when it is needed. Getting
                rid of clutter eliminates 40 percent of housework in an average home, and 80 percent of clutter is the
                result of disorganization, not lack of space. When homes are neat and orderly, they increase in value,
                safety, and beauty. Simple, organized spaces are the best foundation for developing a creative personal
                design style.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Cultivate creativity. Look for the charms of your living or working space rather than its limitations.
                Build on what the best features seem to be, rather than lamenting what you don't have architecturally.
                Most importantly, look inside yourself—your lifestyle and needs—for the way you want to live. With so
                many furnishing choices and products available today, creativity has few bounds. Great ideas come to
                everyone who studies design. Do not be afraid or intimidated to implement a unique design plan. People
                with great style sometimes do things that are totally unexpected and out of the ordinary, perhaps ahead
                of their time. Although they may seem to abandon all trends in favor of their own preferences, their
                good choices are never made to shock, amaze, or impress anyone. True style and creativity involve tuning
                into and following what is naturally right. They have little to do with what is in fashion, although an
                awareness of fashion is always evident in interiors owned by people with good taste and creativity.
                Fashion passes; style remains. Style ab-hors cliché, cuteness, and conformity in favor of an
                un-compromising approach to first-class design quality and individuality. Truly great design is
                innovative yet demanding of the best.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Personalize the space with things you love. Furnishings should reveal who you are, what you do, where
                you have been, what you have experienced, and who you love. And as you change, your home should respond
                to the person you become.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Cultivate good taste by choosing wisely. When each item of furnishing is thoughtfully selected and
                considered an essential ingredient, there is promise of good taste and great style. It has been said
                that people with good taste know when to stop, just short of excess. Keep the plan simple; let every
                component be beautiful, and add to the mix only when the overall design will benefit. Look ahead to the
                future, and know that we never regret making good decisions, purchasing good quality, and insisting on
                design excellence. Of all the objectives we may choose to incorporate in life, the dedication to
                creating welcoming, attractive, and individual personal interiors is one of the most worth-while. An
                active knowledge of the principles and elements of design helps to ensure tasteful selections that will
                be cherished for years to come.
