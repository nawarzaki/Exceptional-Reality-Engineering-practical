      <h2>IRREGULAR GRIDS</h2>
    </header>

    <h3>Modifying Grids</h3>
    <p>Square, rectangular, and tartan grids are all regular in the
      sense that they consist of regularly recurring elements
      regulated by orthogonal spatial relationships. They are
      capable of growth in a predictable manner, and even if
      one or more elements is missing, the pattern of the whole
      remains recognizable. Even radial grids have recurring
      relationships defined by their circular geometry.</p>

    <p>In architectural design, grids are powerful organizing
      devices. It should be noted, however, that regular grids are
      only generalized patterns that can be modified and made
      specific in response to circumstances of program, site, and
      materials. The objective is to develop a grid that integrates
      form, space, and structure into a cohesive whole.</p>

    <ul>
      <h3>Modifying by Addition or Subtraction </h3>
      <li>
        <p>A regular grid can be modified by selectively removing
          portions or extending structural bays in one or more
          directions.</p>

      <h3>Modifying Scale and Proportions </h3>
      <li>
        <p>A regular grid can be modified by enlarging the bay
          spans in one or two directions, creating a hierarchical
          set of modules differentiated by size and proportion.</p>

      <h2>Modifying by Addition or Subtraction</h2>

    <p>Regular grids can be extended horizontally and vertically to
      form new compositions of forms and spaces. Such additive
      compositions can be used to express growth, establish
      a linear sequence of spaces, or to collect a number of
      secondary spaces about a major or parent form.</p>

      <p>Subtractive modifications result from the selective removal

        <p>A major space larger in scale than that established by
          the grid, such as a court or atrium, or</p>

        <p>A recessed entry space.</p>

        <p>For subtractive modifications, the regular grid should be

      <h2>Modifying Proportions</h2>
    </header>
    <p>To accommodate the specific dimensional requirements of
      spaces and functions, a grid can be made irregular in one
      or two directions, creating a hierarchical set of modules
      differentiated by size, scale, and proportion.</p>

    <p>When the structural grid is irregular in only one direction,
      the collector beams or girders can span uneven bay
      lengths while the feeder beams or joists retain constant
      spans. In some cases, it might be more economical to have
      the collector beams or girders have equal spans while
      the feeder beams or joists have varying span lengths. In
      either case, the unequal spans will result in the spanning
      systems having different depths.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/STRUCTURAL PATTERNS/Modifying Proportions 1.png" alt="STRUCTURAL PATTERNS"
        style="height: 24%; width: 48%;">

        style="height: 24%; width: 66%;">
    </figure> <br><br>

    <p>The structural grid can be made irregular in two directions
      to achieve a tighter fit between structure, space, and
      function. In this case, the direction of spanning elements
      will vary along with the proportion of the structural bays.
      As the structural bays vary in proportion, it is important
      to understand that the tributary load areas for both the
      spanning members and vertical supports will vary as well.</p>

      <h2>Accommodating Large-Scale Spaces</h2>
    </header>
    <p>When spaces are much larger in scale than those required
      for typical uses, such as for auditoriums and gymnasiums,
      they can disrupt the normal rhythm of a structural grid and
      the increased spans and resulting loads—both gravity and
      lateral—on vertical supports require special consideration.</p>

    <p>Larger-than-normal spaces may be embedded in the
      structural grid, be separate but attached to the grid, or
      be large enough to encompass support functions into its
      volume. In the first two instances, it is usually best to have
      the vertical supports of the large-scale space be equal to
      or some multiple of the regular support grid. In this way,
      horizontal continuity can be maintained throughout the
      structure.</p>

    <p>A large-scale space that is embedded within a grid can
      be supported and buttressed by the structure of the
      surrounding spaces. If the grid of the large space does
      not align with that of the surrounding spaces, then some
      sort of transitional structure would be necessary to
      accommodate the shift.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/STRUCTURAL PATTERNS/Large_Scale 1.png" alt="STRUCTURAL PATTERNS"
        style="height: 24%; width: 39%;">
    </figure> <br><br>

    <p>The desired architectural expression may be that of a
      large-scale space that is separate from but connected to
      an adjacent structure. Articulating the large-scale space
      in this way can alleviate the difficulty that may arise
      when two different types of structural systems meet or
      when two structural grids are misaligned. In either case,
      a third structural system would be required to make the
      transition.</p>

        style="height: 24%; width: 39%;">
    </figure> <br><br>

    <p>A large-scale space that incorporates secondary
      functions and spaces into its volume typically requires a
      long-spanning structural system.</p>

      <h2>Contrasting Geometries</h2>
    </header>

    <p>A regular grid can meet a grid of contrasting geometry to
      reflect differing requirements of interior space and exterior
      form or to express the importance of a form or space
      within its context. Whenever this occurs, there are three
      ways in which to handle the geometric contrast.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The two contrasting geometries can be kept separate
          and be linked by a third structural system.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The two contrasting geometries can overlap with either
          one dominating the other, or the two combining to form
          a third geometry.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>One of the two contrasting geometries can incorporate
          the other into its field.</p>
      </li>

      <p>The transitional or interstitial space formed by the
        intersection of two contrasting geometries can, if large
        or unique enough, begin to attain an importance or
        significance of its own.</p>

      <h2>Contrasting Orientation</h2>
    </header>

    <p>Just as two structural grids may have contrasting
      geometries, they also might have differing orientations
      to address unique features of a site, accommodate an
      existing pattern of movement, or express contrasting
      forms or functions within a single composition. And as
      in the case of contrasting geometries, there are three
      ways in which to resolve how the two grids that differ in
      orientation resolve into a single structure.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The two grids can be kept separate and be linked by a
          third structural system.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The two grids can overlap with either one dominating
          the other, or the two combining to form a third
          geometry.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>One of the two grids can incorporate the other into its
          field.</p>
      </li>

      <p>The transitional or interstitial space formed by the
        intersection of two geometries having contrasting
        orientations can, if large or unique enough, begin to attain
        an importance or significance of its own.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/STRUCTURAL PATTERNS/Contrasting Orientation 1.jpg"

        <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/STRUCTURAL PATTERNS/Contrasting Orientation 3.jpg"

    </ul>


    <figure>

        style="height: 24%; width: 42%;">
    </figure> <br><br>

    <p>The transitional link between two geometric
      orientations may reflect either one of the orientations
      or neither of them. If the linking space conforms to
      one of the orientations, the contrasting orientation
      will tend to be emphasized.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/STRUCTURAL PATTERNS/Contrasting Orientation 5.png" alt="STRUCTURAL PATTERNS"
        style="height: 24%; width: 42%;">
      <figcaption>
        <p><b>Contrasting orientations can lead to the linking
            space having unique spanning conditions.</b></p>
      </figcaption>
    </figure> <br><br>

    <p>When two grids of contrasting orientation overlap,
      one will tend to dominate the other. The ascendency
      of one grid can be further emphasized by a change
      in vertical scale. Strong structural and architectural
      emphasis is placed on the exceptional spaces where
      one can experience both geometries.</p>

    <figure>

        style="height: 24%; width: 42%;">

      <h2>Accommodating Irregular Spaces</h2>
    </header>

    <p>Design ideas are often generated not from the pattern of
      structural supports and spanning elements but rather from
      the desired ordering of program spaces and the formal
      qualities of the resulting composition.</p>

    <p> In a typical building
      program, there are usually requirements for various kinds
      of spaces. There may be requirements for spaces that are
      singular and unique in their function or significance to the
      building organization; others may be flexible in use and can
      be freely manipulated.</p>

    <p>Discrete irregular spaces may be framed by the structure
      to conform with and reinforce the program requirements of
      the spatial volume.</p>

    <figure>

    </figure> <br><br>

    <p>This usually involves working back and forth between
      a structural concept and the program requirements for
      the space, searching for an appropriate fit between the
      structural strategy and the vision for the formal, aesthetic
      and performance qualities of the resulting spatial
      environment.</p>

    <p>A discrete irregular space may also be developed as an
      independent structure with a separate structural system
      and geometry superimposed over the building as a
      whole. Although appropriate to accommodate the spatial
      requirements of such spaces as theaters, concert halls, and
      large galleries, this strategy typically requires long-span
      spanning systems. </p>

      <h2>Accommodating Irregular Shapes</h2>
    </header>
    <p>It is advisable to try to recognize the inherent geometry
      embedded in irregular plan shapes when attempting to
      develop a strategy for its structural system. Even the
      most irregular of plan shapes can often be dissected into
      parts which can be seen to be transformations of regular
      geometric shapes.</p>

    <p>The manner in which an irregular shape or form might be
      constructed will often suggest logical options for a framing
      strategy. This may be as simple as using the center of
      an arc for a radial framing system or framing parallel or
      perpendicular to a significant wall or plane within an
      irregular geometry. Curves, especially, possess a number of
      properties for establishing the basis for a framing strategy. </p>

    <p>One might use the radius or center of an arc, a point that is
      tangent to the arc, or in the case of double curvatures, the
      inflection point where a change in curvature occurs. The
      approach one takes will depend on the design intent and
      how the structural strategy might reinforce the concept.</p>

    <figure>

        <p><b>Equal column spacing along the arc

      <figcaption>
        <p><b>Equal column spacing on the rectangular
            grid creates a subtle inequality of
            column spacing along the arc.</b></p>
      </figcaption>
    </figure> <br><br>

    <p>Although structural framing systems are usually developed
      in plan, consideration should also be given to the effect
      of the structure on the vertical aspects of a building—its
      elevations and the scale of its interior spaces. If column
      locations will be expressed in the facade, for example,
      the visible effect of a regular column spacing on a curving
      exterior wall plane should be considered.</p>

    <p>Part of the challenge of structuring irregular plan shapes
      is to minimize the structural inefficiency that often results
      from the inevitable variations in span lengths.</p>

      <h2>Accommodating Irregular Edge Conditions</h2>
    </header>

    <p>Buildings may be shaped by the configuration of the site,
      the possibilities for view corridors and outlook, the edge
      conditions of streets and street frontages, or by the desire
      to preserve unique topographic features. Any of these
      conditions can lead to an irregular geometry that must be
      rationalized with the building program and the structural
      system devised to house it.</p>

    <p>One strategy is to reduce the building form into orthogonal
      shapes with different orientations. This will often result
      in exceptional conditions that must be resolved at
      the intersections between the orthogonal parts of the
      composition.</p>

    <p>Another approach is to adapt a series of equivalent spatial
      units or formal elements to an irregular edge condition by
      bending the linear array along the path of the irregularity.
      The irregularity can be regularized by visualizing it as a
      series of curvatures and recognizing the center of radius
      for each arc segment as well as the points of inflection
      where changes of curvature occur.</p>

      to the other. In these situations, differences between
      the parts may be expressed in the scale or grain of the
      respective structural patterns.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>When the scale and grain of two grids are similar, any
          differences can be resolved simply by selectively adding
          or subtracting bays. If there is an established grid
          structure, this will emphasize the plane along which the
          shift or shearing occurs.</p>

      </li>

      <li>
        <p>A shearing of the grid can occur along a shift in spatial
          scale or grain. This may be accomplished using a
          common girder along the shear line. Because column
          spacings can vary along a bearing line, especially if
          beam spans are reasonably short, the positions of the
          columns supporting the girder can respond easily to
          local conditions.</p>

      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Two structural patterns that differ in scale and grain can
          meet and align easier if the larger grid structure is some
          multiple of the smaller grid structure.</p>

        </figure> <br><br>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>If two primary grids that differ in scale, proportion, or
          grain cannot be resolved along a bearing line of columns
          and beams or girders, a third structure can be introduced
          to mediate between the two structures. Having a
          relatively short span, this mediating structure can often
          have a finer grain, which can help resolve the different
          spacings and support patterns of the two primary grids.</p>

      </li>

      <li>
        <p> If adjacent occupancies can tolerate the degree of
          separation afforded by a bearing wall, the wall itself can
          serve to join two contrasting structural grids. The nature
          of a bearing wall divides a space into two distinct fields.
          Any penetration through the bearing wall can take on
          additional significance as a portal or threshold between
          the two elements.</p>

        </figure> <br><br>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>A pair of bearing walls defines a field of space
          distinguished by a strong directional quality toward its
          open ends. This fundamental type of structural pattern is
          often used in projects consisting of repetitive units, such
          as multifamily housing, because they simultaneously
          serve to isolate the units from one another, curb the
          passage of sound, and check the spread of fire.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>A series of parallel bearing walls can organize a series
          of linear spaces, with the solidity of the bearing walls
          being able to accommodate varying degrees of slippage
          or offsets, from small to large.</p>
