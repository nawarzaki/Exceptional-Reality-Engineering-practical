        <h2>Color Inﬂuencing Factors</h2>
      </header>

      <div id="Inﬂuencing_Factors">

        <ul id="Texture_and_Material">
          <li>
            <header>
              <h2>Texture and Material</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Texture and materials catch and absorb or reflect light.
              Smooth surfaces reflect light, which makes colors appear lighter and more intense.
            </p>

            <p>Grained wood and textures absorb or refract (break up) the light, causing colors to appear darker.
            </p>

            <p>Thus, an exact match in colored samples will not appear as precise when installed. The attempt to
              match
              paint, drapery, carpet, upholstery, and laminates may cause frustration and dissonance in the
              finished
              interior. </p>

            <p>It is wiser to blend color by selecting various values or harmonious undertones and allow inherent
              differences to enhance the entire color scheme.</p>
          </li>
          <br>

          <li>
            <header>
              <h2>Color Placement</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Color placement of hues in juxtaposition, or close together, will cause colors to affect one
              another. A
              color placed near green.</p>

            <p>For example, may take on a greenish cast or bring out a greenish undertone. A color selected alone
              and
              then installed in combination with other hues may take on undertones that give a different character
              to
              that color. </p>

            <p>The result may be pleasing or disharmonious. Coordinating samples under similar lighting conditions
              or
              on the site before installation may avoid un-pleasant surprises when the colors become permanent in
              the
              interior.</p>
          </li>
          <br><br>

              <h2>Value Distribution and Contrast</h2>
            </header>
            <p>As defined under the Munsell theory, value is the relative lightness or darkness of a hue or
              neutral,
              or the amount of white and black added. Value distribution is the utilization or placement of value
              for
              a desired result.</p>

            <p>High values are light hues (tints and pastels) or light achromatic (about 7 to 10 on the Munsell
              chart).</p>

            <p>High values visually expand space; they are a useful High-key interiors may seem romantic or
              ethereal
              and less connected to the earth, an effect that can relieve stress but also may cause feelings of
              insecurity.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <header>
              <h2>Midtones</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Are colors at their normal value or natural saturation point and with achromatic values from about
              4 to
              6 according to Munsell. </p>

            <p>They are also mid-value neutralized tones. Mid-tones give a sense of normality and calm. </p>

            <p>They evoke less reaction and are safe, stable, and easy to live with; yet without relief of light
              and
              dark values, mid-tones can become boring. The addition of accents of high/low values and bits of
              bright
              Chroma and shine creates a Shibui effect—a pleasantly long-lived scheme.</p>

          </li>

          <li>
            <header>
              <h2>Dark or low values</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Are shades and darker tones from about 1 to 3 according to Munsell. Dark or low values seem to
              advance
              and close in space; they are useful tool when walls, floors, or ceilings need to seem farther away.
              High
              values make juxtaposed colors seem crisper and cleaner and can unify interiors when used as
              backgrounds.
            </p>

            <p>High-key interiors have predominantly high values. The effect of many tints is an airy, somewhat
              carefree feeling. Pastels produce a soothing and calming interior.</p>

            <p>Low-key: Interiors focus on dark or low values. They can produce a stable, anchored, ponderous, or
              historic effect; an intellectual or research/reading mode; or even a cave-like coziness or comfort
              or
              theatrical setting.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <header>
              <h2>High contrast</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Means that light and dark values are used to give a sharp or bold contrast, precision, drama, or
              excitement and a clean contemporary scheme. </p>

            <p>High-contrast values also look professional and no-nonsense. Value distribution based on nature is
              the
              placing of values in the general pattern seen in nature:</p>
            <ol>

              <li>
                <p> Darker colors are underfoot, creating a sense of security and harmony with gravity.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p> Midtones are in the middle—on walls and around windows, on upholstery, and on linens—giving
                  stability
                  and normality.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>Lighter values are above—in the window and near/on the ceiling—for a sense of expanse and
                  visual or
                  mental freedom.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>

        </header>
        <ul>

          <li>
            <p>Light-value and bright color groups produce feelings of spontaneity and happiness.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Light and dull or neutralized colors produce feelings of calm and relaxation.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Dark and dull or neutralized colors are serious and profound.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Dark values and bright chroma (jewel tones) suggest richness and strength.</p>
          </li>
          <p>The psychology of color can be seen in the effects produced by warm and cool colors.</p>
        </ul>

        <br>


        <header>
          <h3>Warm colors</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          visually and psychologically warm the temperature of an interior. They are inviting, homey, optimistic,
          encouraging, and stimulating to the appetite, and they facilitate the blending of objects, patterns, and
          textures. Warm colors also tend to reduce space and create more intimate interiors. Keep in mind that
          these
          are generalities. Depending on the value and the intensity of the chroma, colors can be very warm (high
          chroma, which intensifies these attributes), warm, or only slightly warm (middle to low chroma, which
          deemphasizes the qualities listed).
        </p>

        <br>

        <header>
          <h3>Cool colors</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          generally calm and relax the mind and body, giving the impression of lack of pressure and plenty of time
          to
          wait or to accomplish tasks. Cool colors often suggest more formality and precision of detail, pattern,
          and
          color. They visually expand space, and thus are effective tools in small, cramped quarters. <br>
          Cool colors subdue the appetite and emotions. Very cool colors are intense, cool colors are middle
          chroma,
          and
          slightly cool colors are low in chroma (neutralized).
