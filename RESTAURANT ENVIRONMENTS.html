        <h2>RESTAURANT ENVIRONMENTS </h2>
      </header>

      <div>
        <p>Restaurant types range from utilitarian fast-food purveyors to full-service restaurants with
          elaborate themes. Restaurant design encompasses a great number of issues regarding
          adjacencies, kitchen layouts, lighting, acoustics, and so forth. The interior designer must be
          familiar with each, especially with the dimensional criteria for seating layouts. </p>

        <p>Before planning the seating layout, the designer must understand the restaurant concept. The
          concept should define the type of dining experience offered, the intended clientele, the hours
          of operation, and the menu.</p>

        <p> If the restaurateur's idea is to put the workings of the chef on
          display, for example, then the seating should be arranged so that the kitchen is visible from
          every table. Equally, the spacing between tables can have a substantial impact on the charac-
          ter of a restaurant.</p>

        <p>Tables closely packed will result in a loud and lively space, since patrons
          need to compete with their neighbors to be heard. Conversely, tables spaced far apart tend to
          separate diners into quieter pockets of conversation. </p>
      </div>
      <br><br>

      <div>
        <header>
          <h4>Types of Seating</h4>
        </header>

        <p>Restaurant seating falls into three general categories: loose chairs, built-in seating (for
          example, banquettes), and bar seating. Seat height is typically 17 to 18 inches (432 to 57 millimeters) at a
          table or low counter. </p>

        <p>Bar seating typically ranges from 30 to 34 inches (762 to 864
          millimeters) in height. All seats should be a minimum of 16 square inches (406 square millimeters). For the
          full-service dining experience, consider the use of padded seats and armchairs
          for ease of getting in and out of the seat.</p>
      </div> <br><br>

      <div>
        <header>
          <h4>Tables and Counters </h4>
        </header>

        <p>In the restaurant trade, tables are known as tops. The most common sizes are two tops
          (seating two people) and four tops (seating four people). Beyond these sizes, tables are
          typically combined or expanded. </p>

        <p>Some tables have flip-up corners, which convert a square
          table seating four to a round table seating six people. Table height is typically 30 inches (762
          millimeters). A square table with a minimum dimension of 36 inches (914 millimeters) across
          can accommodate four people. </p>

        <p>A square table with a minimum dimension of 24 inches (610
          millimeters) across is acceptable for two; however, 30 inches (762 millimeters) is preferable.
          Smaller tables are acceptable when only drink service is provided. </p>

        <p>Counters range in height
          from 28 to 36 inches (711 to 914 millimeters); however, the Americans with Disabilities Act
          (ADA) requires that 60 linear inches (1 524 millimeters) of a counter be no more than 34 inches
          (864 millimeters) high to accommodate patrons in wheelchairs. </p>

        </header>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Spacing between Tables</h4>
            <p>As long as the spacing between tables meets the minimum dimensions required for an access
              aisle, the spacing is subjective and driven mostly by the restaurant concept. Full-service restaurants
              provide more space between tables for a comfortable dining experience, while fast-
              food restaurants maximize the number of seats.</p>
            <p>by the local building code and by the ADA, which specifies a minimum width of 36 inches (914
              millimeters) in the access aisles and also requires that all accessible tables be located adjacent to an
              access aisle. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Interior Finishes </h4>
            <p>Interior finishes are the most tangible elements that a designer can use to describe the type
              and quality of the restaurant. Certainly, materials appropriate for the public areas will differ
              from those appropriate for the kitchen;</p>
            <p>but in both areas, fire-retardant materials must be
              utilized. In addition to the quality of the materials specified, it is important to consider their
              maintenance standards to ensure their suitability for the type of restaurant.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Lighting </h4>
            <p>The ambiance of a restaurant will be informed by the lighting design. Low-level mood lighting
              is typical of fine dining, while bright lighting offers a more casual dining experience. Over the
              course of a day, restaurants can change the lighting to suggest different moods.</p>
            <p>Most restaurant lighting is incandescent because of the warm tones that the lamps provide; however,
              fluorescent lighting is more energy efficient and may be more appropriate in the kitchen areas.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Acoustics </h4>
            <p>The acoustics in a restaurant go hand-in-hand with the concept. In some restaurants, for example, the
              reverberation of hard surfaces adds to the desired effect of the dining experience.
              There are a number of ways to control the acoustics in an environment, as long as the desired
              effect is understood.</p>
            <p>The simplest way to control acoustics is through sound-absorptive
              materials. These can range from carpet on the floor to fabric paneling on the walls to sound-
              absorptive tiles in the ceiling. Another strategy worth considering is to compartmentalize the
              restaurant into different types of rooms with different noise levels to suit the various patrons. </p>
