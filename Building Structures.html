        <h1>Building Structures</h1>
      </header>



      <p>Buildings—the relatively permanent constructions we
        erect on a plot of land for habitable use—have developed
        over the course of history from simple shelters constructed
        of sticks, mud-brick, and stones to the more sophisticated
        constructions of concrete, steel, and glass of today.
        Throughout this evolution of building technology, what has
        remained constant is the enduring presence of some form
        of structural system capable of withstanding the forces of
        gravity, wind, and oftentimes, earthquakes.</p>

      <p>We can define a structural system as a stable assembly
        of elements designed and constructed to function as a
        whole in supporting and transmitting applied loads safely
        to the ground without exceeding the allowable stresses in
        the members. While the forms and materials of structural
        systems have evolved with advances in technology and
        culture, not to mention the lessons learned from numerous
        building failures, they remain essential to the existence of
        all buildings, no matter their scale, context, or use.</p>

      <p>The brief historical survey that follows illustrates the
        development of structural systems over time, from the
        earliest attempts to satisfy the fundamental human need
        for shelter against sun, wind, and rain, to the longer spans,
        greater heights, and increasing complexity of modern
        architecture.</p>

        <p>While cave dwelling endures in various forms in different
          parts of the world, most architecture is created by
          assembling materials to define the limits of space as
          well as to provide shelter, house activities, commemorate
          events, and signify meaning. Early houses consisted of
          rough timber frames with mud-brick walls and thatched
          roofing.</p>

        <p>Sometimes pits were dug in the earth to provide
          additional warmth and protection; at other times, dwellings
          were elevated on stilts for ventilation in warm, humid
          climates or to rise above the shores of rivers and lakes. The
          use of heavy timber for the structural framing of walls and
          roof spans continued to develop over time and was refined,
          especially in the architecture of China, Korea, and Japan.</p>

        <p>There is evidence that the Chinese used a mixture of
          lime and volcanic ash to build the pyramids of Shaanxi
          several thousand years ago, but it was the Romans who
          developed a hydraulic concrete from pozzolanic ash similar
          to the modern concrete made from Portland cement.
          The formulation of Portland cement by Joseph Aspdin in
          1824 and the invention of reinforced concrete, attributed
          to Joseph-Louis Lambot in 1848, stimulated the use of
          concrete for architectural structures.</p>

        <p>The modern era in steelmaking began when Henry
          Bessemer described a process for mass-producing steel
          relatively cheaply in 1856.</p>

          elevator to prevent the fall of the cab if
          the cable is broken. The first Otis elevator
          is installed in New York City in 1857.</p>

        <p>1824: Joseph Aspdin patents the
          manufacture of Portland cement.</p>

          <h1>ARCHITECTURAL STRUCTURES</h1>
        </header>

        <p>Historical review conveys a sense not only
          of how structural systems have evolved but also how
          they have had, and will continue to have, an impact on
          architectural design.</p>

        <p>Architecture embodies ineffable yet
          sensible, aesthetic qualities that emerge from a union of
          space, form, and structure. In providing support for other
          building systems and our activities, a structural system
          enables the shape and form of a building and its spaces,
          similar to the way in which our skeletal system gives
          shape and form to our body and support to its organs and
          tissues. So when we speak of architectural structures, we
          refer to those that unite with form and space in a coherent
          manner.</p>

        <p>Designing an architectural structure therefore involves
          more than the proper sizing of any single element or
          component, or even the design of any particular structural
          assembly. It is not simply the task of balancing and
          resolving forces. Rather, it requires that we consider
          the manner in which the overall configuration and scale
          of structural elements, assemblies, and connections
          encapsulate an architectural idea, reinforce the
          architectural form and spatial composition of a design
          proposal, and enable its constructibility. </p>

        <p>This then requires
          an awareness of structure as a system of interconnected
          and interrelated parts, an understanding of the generic
          types of structural systems, as well as an appreciation for
          the capabilities of certain types of structural elements and
          assemblies.</p>

        <ul>
          <p>There are three fundamental ways in which the structural
            system can relate to the form of an architectural design.
            These fundamental strategies are:</p>

          <li>
            <p>Exposing the structural system</p>
          </li>
          <li>

          <header>
            <h2>Exposing the Structure</h2>
          </header>

          <p>Historically, stone- and masonry-bearing wall systems
            dominated architecture until the advent of iron and steel
            construction in the late-18th century. These structural
            systems also functioned as the primary system of
            enclosure and therefore expressed the form of the
            architecture, typically in an honest and straightforward
            manner.</p>

          <p>Whatever formal modifications were made were usually a
            result of molding or carving the structural material in such
            a way as to create additive elements, subtractive voids, or
            reliefs within the mass of the structure.</p>

          <p>Even in the modern era, there are examples of buildings
            that exposed their structural systems—whether in timber,
            steel, or concrete—using them effectively as the primary
            architectonic form-givers.</p>

          <header>
            <h2>Concealing the Structure</h2>
          </header>

          <p>In this strategy, the structural system is concealed or
            obscured by the exterior cladding and roofing of the
            building. Some reasons for concealing the structure
            are practical, as when the structural elements must be
            clad to make them fire-resistant, or contextual, as when
            the desired exterior form is at odds with interior space
            requirements. In the latter case, the structure may organize
            the interior spaces while the form of the exterior shell
            responds to site conditions or constraints.</p>

          <p>The designer may simply want freedom of expression for
            the shell without considering how the structural system
            might aid or hinder formal decisions. Or the structural
            system may be obscured through neglect rather than
            intent. In both of these cases, legitimate questions arise as
            to whether the resulting design is intentional or accidental,
            willful or, dare we say, careless.</p>

            <h2>Celebrating the Structure</h2>
          </header>

          <p>Rather than being merely exposed, the structural system
            can be exploited as a design feature, celebrating the
            form and materiality of the structure. The often exuberant
            nature of shell and membrane structures makes them
            appropriate candidates for this category.</p>

          <p>There are also those structures that dominate
            by the sheer forcefulness with which they express
            the way they resolve the forces acting on them. These
            types of structures often become iconic symbols due to
            their striking imagery. Think Eiffel Tower or the Sydney
            Opera House.</p>

          <p>When judging whether a building celebrates its structure
            or not, we should be careful to differentiate structural
            expression from expressive forms which are not, in truth,
            structural but only appear to be so.</p>

            <h2>Spatial Composition</h2>
          </header>
          <p>The form of a structural system and the pattern of its
            supporting and spanning elements can be related to the
            spatial layout and composition of a design in two fundamental
            ways. The first is a correspondence between the form of the
            structural system and that of the spatial composition. The
            second is a looser fit in which the structural form and pattern
            allow more freedom or flexibility in spatial layout.</p>

          <header>
            <h2>Correspondence</h2>
          </header>
          <p>Where there is a correspondence between structural form and
            spatial composition, either the pattern of structural supports
            and spanning systems can prescribe the disposition of spaces
            within a building or the spatial layout can suggest a certain
            type of structural system. In the design process, which comes
            first?</p>

          <p>In ideal cases, we consider both space and structure together
            as co-determinants of architectural form. But composing
            spaces according to needs and desires often precedes thinking
            about structure. On the other hand, there are times when
            structural form can be the driving force in the design process.</p>

          <p>In either case, structural systems that prescribe a pattern of
            spaces of certain sizes and dimensions, or even a pattern of
            use, may not allow for flexibility in future use or adaptation.</p>

            <h2>Contrast</h2>
          </header>

          <p>When there is a lack of correspondence between
            structural form and spatial composition, either may take
            precedence. The structure may be large enough to shelter
            or encompass a series of spaces within its volume, or the
            spatial composition may dominate a concealed structure.
            An irregular or asymmetrical structural system may
            envelop a more regular spatial composition, or a structural
            grid may provide a uniform set or network of points
            against which a freer spatial composition can be gauged
            or contrasted.</p>

          <p>A distinction between space and structure may be
            desirable to provide flexibility of layout; allow for growth
            and expansion; make visible the identity of different
            building systems; or express differences between interior
            and exterior needs, desires, and relationships.</p>

          <h2>STRUCTURAL SYSTEMS</h2>
        </header>

        <p>A system can be defined as an assembly of interrelated or
          interdependent parts forming a more complex and unified
          whole and serving a common purpose. A building can be
          understood to be the physical embodiment of a number of
          systems and subsystems that must necessarily be related,
          coordinated, and integrated with each other as well as
          with the three-dimensional form and spatial organization
          of the building as a whole.</p>

        <p>The structural system of a building, in particular, consists
          of a stable assembly of structural elements designed and
          constructed to support and transmit applied loads safely
          to the ground without exceeding the allowable stresses
          in the members. </p>

        <p>Each of the structural members has a
          unitary character and exhibits a unique behavior under
          an applied load. But before individual structural elements
          and members can be isolated for study and resolution,
          it is important for the designer to understand how the
          structural system accommodates and supports in a holistic
          manner the desired programmatic and contextual forms,
          spaces, and relationships of an architectural scheme.</p>

        <p>Regardless of the size and scale of a building, it comprises
          physical systems of structure and enclosure that define
          and organize its forms and spaces. These elements
          can be further categorized into a substructure and a
          superstructure.</p>

        <br><br>

        <header>
          <h2>Substructure</h2>
        </header>

        <p>The substructure is the lowest division of a building—its
          foundation—constructed partly or wholly below the
          surface of the ground. Its primary function is to support
          and anchor the superstructure above and transmit its loads
          safely into the earth. Because it serves as a critical link
          in the distribution and resolution of building loads, the
          foundation system, while normally hidden from view, must
          be designed to both accommodate the form and layout
          of the superstructure above and respond to the varying
          conditions of soil, rock, and water below.</p>

        <p>The principal loads on a foundation are the combination of
          dead and live loads acting vertically on the superstructure.
          In addition, a foundation system must anchor the
          superstructure against wind-induced sliding, overturning,
          and uplift, withstand the sudden ground movements of
          an earthquake, and resist the pressure imposed by the
          surrounding soil mass and groundwater on basement
          walls. In some cases, a foundation system may also have
          to counter the thrust from arched or tensile structures.</p>

          <h3>An important influence on the type of substructure we
            select, and consequently, the structural pattern we design,
            is the site and context for a building.</h3>

          <li>
            <p>Relation to superstructure: The type and pattern of
              required foundation elements impact, if not dictate,
              the layout of supports for the superstructure. Vertical
              continuity in load transmission should be maintained as
              much as possible for structural efficiency.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Soil type: The integrity of a building structure depends
              ultimately on the stability and strength under loading of
              the soil or rock underlying the foundation. The bearing
              capacity of the underlying soil or rock may therefore
              limit the size of a building or require deep foundations.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Relation to topography: The topographic character
              of a building site has both ecological and structural
              implications and consequences, requiring that any site
              development be sensitive to natural drainage patterns,
              conditions conducive to flooding, erosion, or slides, and
              provisions for habitat protection.</p>

        <header>
          <h2>Shallow Foundations</h2>
        </header>

        <ul>
          <p>Shallow or spread foundations are employed when stable
            soil of adequate bearing capacity occurs relatively near
            to the ground surface. They are placed directly below the
            lowest part of a substructure and transfer building loads
            directly to the supporting soil by vertical pressure. Shallow
            foundations can take any of the following geometric forms:</p>

          <li>
            <p>Point: Column footings</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Line: Foundation walls and footings</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Plane: Mat foundations</p>
            <p>thick, heavily reinforced
              concrete slabs that serve as a single monolithic
              footing for a number of columns or an entire building—
              are used when the allowable bearing capacity of
              a foundation soil is low relative to building loads
              and interior column footings become so large that it
              becomes more economical to merge them into a single
              slab. Mat foundations may be stiffened by a grid of ribs,
              beams, or walls.</p>

        <p>Deep foundations consist of caissons or piles that extend

          a more appropriate bearing stratum of rock or dense sands
          and gravels well below the superstructure. </p>

            appropriate choices for a structural system can be made if
            one understands the formal attributes the various systems
            develop in responding to applied forces and redirecting
            these forces to their foundations.</p>

              decking.</p>

          <p>Before proceeding to a discussion of structural design,
            it might be useful to distinguish between structural
            design and structural analysis. </p>

          <li>
            <p>Structural analysis is the
              process of determining the ability of a structure or any of
              its constituent members, either existing or assumed, to
              safely carry a given set of loads without material distress
              or excessive deformation, given the arrangement, shape,
              and dimensions of the members, the types of connections
              and supports utilized, and the allowable stresses of the
              materials employed. In other words, structural analysis
              can occur only if given a specific structure and certain load
              conditions.</p>

            <p>Structural design, on the other hand, refers to the process
              of arranging, interconnecting, sizing, and proportioning the
              members of a structural system in order to safely carry
              a given set of loads without exceeding the allowable
              stresses of the materials employed. Structural design,
              similar to other design activities, must operate in an
              environment of uncertainty, ambiguity, and approximation.
              It is a search for a structural system that can meet not only
              the load requirements but also address the architectural,
              urban design, and programmatic issues at hand.</p>

          <p>The first step in the structural design process may be
            stimulated by the nature of the architectural design, its site
            and context, or the availability of certain materials.</p>

          <li>
            <p>The architectural design idea may elicit a specific type

          <h2>Detailing of Connections</h2>
        </header>

        <p>The manner in which forces are transferred from one
          structural element to the next and how a structural
          system performs as a whole depend to a great extent
          on the types of joints and connections used. Structural
          elements can be joined to each other in three ways.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Butt joints allow one of the elements to be continuous
              and usually require a third mediating element to make
              the connection.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Overlapping joints allow all of the connected elements
              to bypass each other and be continuous across the
              joint.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The joining elements can also be molded or shaped to
              form a structural connection.</p>
          </li>

            connections.</p>

            <p>Pin or hinge joints allow rotation but resist translation
              in any direction.</p>

          <li>
            <p>Roller joints or supports allow rotation but resist
              translation in a direction perpendicular into or away
              from its face.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Rigid or fixed joints maintain the angular relationship
              between the joined elements, restrain rotation and
              translation in any direction, and provide both force and
              moment resistance.</p>

          <p>In the design process, we tend to think first of the larger
            holistic pattern before we consider the elemental structural
            units that make up the larger whole. So as we strategize
            to develop a structural plan for a building, we should
            consider both the essential qualities of the architectural
            composition and the nature and configuration of the
            structural elements. This leads to a series of fundamental
            questions:</p>

          <h3>Building Design</h3>
          <li>
            <p>Is there an overarching form required or does the
              architectural composition consist of articulated parts? If
              so, are these parts to be hierarchically ordered?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Are the principal architectural elements planar or linear
              in nature?</p>
          </li>

          <h3>Building Program</h3>
          <li>
            <p>Are there required relationships between the desirable
              scale and proportion of the program spaces, the
              spanning capability of the structural system, and the
              resulting layout and spacing of supports?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Is there a compelling spatial reason for one-way or two-
              way spanning systems?</p>
          </li>

          <h3>Systems Integration</h3>
          <li>
            <p>How might the mechanical and other building systems
              be integrated with the structural system?</p>
          </li>

          <h3>Code Requirements</h3>
          <li>
            <p>What are the building code requirements for the
              intended use, occupancy, and scale of building?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>What is the type of construction and what are the
              structural materials required?</p>

          <h3>Economic Feasibility</h3>
          <li>
            <p>How might material availability, fabrication processes,
              transportation requirements, labor and equipment
              requirements, and erection time influence the choice of
              a structural system?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Is there a need to allow for expansion and growth either

        <h3>Legal Constraints</h3>

        <p>There exists a regulated relationship between the size
          (height and area) of a building and its intended use,
          occupancy load, and type of construction. Understanding
          the projected scale of a building is important because a
          building's size is related to the type of structural system
          required and the materials that may be employed for its
          structure and construction.</p>

          <h2>Zoning Ordinances</h2>
        </header>

        <p>Zoning ordinances constrain the allowable bulk (height and
          area) and shape of a building based on its location in a
          municipality and position on its site, usually by specifying
          various aspects of its size.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>How much of the land can be covered by a building
              structure and the total floor area that may be constructed
              can be expressed as percentages of the lot area.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The maximum width and depth a building may have can
              be expressed as percentages of the dimensions of the
              site.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Zoning ordinances can also specify how tall the building
              structure can be for a particular area in order to provide
              for adequate light, air, and space, and to enhance the
              streetscape and pedestrian environment.</p>
          </li>

          <p>The size and shape of a building are also controlled
            indirectly by specifying the minimum required distances
            from the structure to the property lines of the site in order
            to provide for air, light, solar access, and privacy.</p>

          <li>
            <p>Property lines</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Required front, side, and rear setbacks</p>

          </figure> <br><br>

        </ul>

        <p>Building codes specify the fire-resistance ratings of
          materials and construction required for a building,
          depending on its location, use and occupancy, and height
          and area per floor.</p>

        <h2>Building Height and Area</h2>

        <p>In addition to zoning ordinances that may limit the use
          and the overall floor area, height, and bulk of a building,
          building codes, such as the International Building Code®
          (IBC), limit the maximum height and area per floor of a
          building according to construction type and occupancy
          group, expressing the intrinsic relationship between degree
          of fire resistance, size of a building, and nature of an
          occupancy. </p>

        <p>The larger a building, the greater the number
          of occupants, and the more hazardous the occupancy, the
          more fire-resistant the structure should be. The intent
          is to protect a building from fire and to contain a fire for
          the time required to safely evacuate occupants and for a
          firefighting response to occur. The limitation on size may
          be exceeded if the building is equipped with an automatic
          fire sprinkler system, or if it is divided by fire walls into
          areas not exceeding the size limitation.</p>

          <h2>Maximum Height and Area</h2>
        </header>

        <p>In IBC Table 503, the allowable height and area of a
          building are determined by the intersection of occupancy
          group and construction type. As occupancy is usually
          determined before heights and areas, the table will
          typically be entered by reading down the list of occupancy
          groups to find the occupancy that fits the building design.
          Reading across leads to the allowable heights and building
          areas based on types of construction.</p>

        <p>Note that the distinction between A and B categories
          of construction types is one of level of fire resistance.
          Because category A is of higher fire resistance, Type A
          buildings of any construction type have higher allowable
          heights and areas than Type B buildings. Using the
          principle of classifying occupancies by degree of hazard
          and building types by fire-resistance, the higher the level of
          fire and life safety, the larger and taller a building can be.</p>

        <p>Heights are expressed in two ways. The first is height in
          feet above the grade plane and is generally independent
          of occupancy, but tied to fire-resistance; the second is
          height in stories and is tied to occupancy. Both sets of
          criteria apply to each analysis. This is to avoid having high
          floor-to-floor heights between stories that could generate
          a building exceeding the height limit in feet above grade
          plane if heights were not also tabulated.</p>

          <h2>Types of Construction</h2>
        </header>
        <p>The IBC classifies the construction of a building according
          to the fire resistance of its major elements:</p>

        <ul>
          <h3>Type I </h3>
          <li>
            <p>Type I buildings have their major building elements
              constructed of noncombustible materials, such as
              concrete, masonry, or steel. Some combustible materials
              are allowed if they are ancillary to the primary structure
              of the building.</p>
          </li>

          <h3>Type II </h3>
          <li>
            <p>Type II buildings are similar to Type I buildings except
              for a reduction in the required fire-resistance ratings of
              the major building elements.</p>
          </li>

          <h3>Type III</h3>
          <li>
            <p>Type III buildings have noncombustible exterior walls
              and major interior elements of any material permitted by
              the code.</p>
          </li>

          <h3>Type IV</h3>
          <li>
            <p>Type IV buildings (Heavy Timber, HT) have
              noncombustible exterior walls and major interior
              elements of solid or laminated wood of specified
              minimum sizes and without concealed spaces.</p>
          </li>

          <h3>Type V</h3>
          <li>
            <p>Type V buildings have structural elements, exterior
              walls, and interior walls of any material permitted by
              the code.</p>
          </li>

          <p>Protected construction requires all major building

        <p>In planning any structural system, there are two attributes
          that should be built into the design, guide its development,
          and ensure its stability, durability, and efficiency. These
          attributes—redundancy and continuity—apply not to
          a specific material or to an individual type of structural
          member, such as a beam, column, or truss, but rather
          to a building structure viewed as a holistic system of
          interrelated parts.</p>

        <p>The failure of a building structure can result from any
          fracturing, buckling, or plastic deformation that renders
          a structural assembly, element, or joint incapable of
          sustaining the load-carrying function for which it was
          designed. To avoid failure, structural designs typically
          employ a factor of safety, expressed as the ratio of the
          maximum stress that a structural member can withstand
          to the maximum stress allowed for it in the use for which
          it is designed.</p>

        <p>Under normal conditions, any structural element
          experiences elastic deformation—deflection or torsion—
          as a force is applied and as it returns to its original shape
          when the force is removed. However, extreme forces, such
          as those generated during an earthquake, can generate
          inelastic deformation in which the element is unable to
          return to its original shape. To resist such extreme forces,
          elements should be constructed of ductile materials.</p>

        <p>Ductility is the property of a material that enables it to
          undergo plastic deformation after being stressed beyond
          the elastic limit and before rupturing. Ductility is a
          desirable property of a structural material, since plastic
          behavior is an indicator of reserve strength and can often
          serve as a visual warning of impending failure. Further, the
          ductility of a structural member allows excessive loads to
          be distributed to other members, or to other parts of the
          same member.</p>

        <br>

        <header>
          <h2>Redundancy</h2>
        </header>

        <p>In addition to using factors of safety and employing ductile
          materials, another method for guarding against structural
          failure is to build redundancy into the structural design.
          A redundant structure includes members, connections, or
          supports not required for a statically determinate structure
          so that if one member, connection, or support fails, others
          exist to provide alternative paths for the transfer of
          forces. In other words, the concept of redundancy involves
          providing multiple load paths whereby forces can bypass a
          point of structural distress or a localized structural failure.</p>

        <p>Redundancy, especially in the lateral-force-resisting
          systems of a structure, is highly desirable in earthquake-
          prone regions. It is also an essential attribute of long-span
          structures in which the failure of a primary truss, arch, or
          girder could lead to a large portion of the structure failing
          or even to its total collapse.</p>

            <p><b>Simple beams supported at their ends are determinate
                structures; their support reactions are easily determined

          <figcaption>
            <p><b>If the same beam is continuous over four columns along
                its length, the structural assembly is indeterminate
                because there are more support reactions than the
                applicable equations of equilibrium. In effect, the
                continuity of the beam across multiple supports results
                in redundant paths for vertical and lateral loads to
                follow to the support foundations.</b></p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>Extending structural redundancy to an entire structural
          system provides protection against progressive collapse
          of the structure. Progressive collapse can be described as
          the spread of an initial local failure from one structural
          member to another, eventually resulting in the collapse of
          an entire structure or a disproportionately large part of it.
          This is a major concern because progressive collapse can
          result in significant structural damage and loss of life.</p>

            <p>A building frame connected with simple joints is
              subject to progressive collapse if one of its members or
              connections fails. With rigid beam-column connections,
              the same frame possesses ample load paths for both
              vertical and lateral loads.</p>

          <h2>Continuity</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Continuity in a structure provides a direct, uninterrupted
          path for loads through a building's structure, from the roof
          level down to the foundation. Continuous load paths help
          to ensure that all forces to which the structure is subjected
          can be delivered from the point of their application to
          the foundation. All elements and connections along
          a load path must have sufficient strength, stiffness,
          and deformation capability to transfer loads without
          compromising the building structure's ability to perform as
          a unit.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>To prevent progressive collapse, structural members and
              assemblies should be adequately tied together so that
              forces and displacements can be transferred between
              vertical and horizontal elements of the structure. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Strong connections increase the overall strength and
              stiffness of a structure by enabling all of the building
              elements to act together as a unit. Inadequate
              connections represent a weak link in a load path and
              are a common cause of the damage to and collapse of
              buildings during earthquakes.</p>

            <p>Rigid, non-structural elements should be isolated

              members and, in the process, create unintended load
              paths that can damage structural elements.</p>

            <p>Disrupting the vertical alignment of columns and bearing
              walls on successive floors cause vertical loads to be
              diverted horizontally, inducing large bending stresses

              lateral forces to the 3rd floor diaphragm, which in turn
              loads the 2nd floor bracing. Lateral forces collected at
              the 2nd floor are then transmitted through the 2nd floor
              diaphragm to the diagonal bracing at the ground floor
              level. The load path is circuitous because of the vertical
              discontinuity of the diagonal bracing.</p>
