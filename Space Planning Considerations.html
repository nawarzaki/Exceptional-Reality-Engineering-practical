        <header>
          <h2> Space Planning Considerations</h2>
        </header>
        <p>In the space planning process, many things need to be considered before the floor plans are drawn and
          construction (or demolition and reconstruction) begins. It is far better to make changes on paper than to rip
          out and reconstruct a space that should have been better planned in the first place.</p>

        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Basic human needs </h4>
              <p>include food, shelter, and clothing. All homes provide shelter, a place to prepare and eat food, and
                space to store and change clothing. Other human needs are to feel safe and accepted through
                relationships of trust and to rest and restore physical and emotional health. </p>

              <p>There are also individual needs: to be productive and creative, to successfully accomplish tasks, and,
                as a result, to feel worthwhile. Residential interiors that meet these needs offer comfortable spaces
                for interacting socially with others, quiet places in which to rest and be alone in order to rejuvenate,
                and functional areas for work or performance of tasks. In nonresidential settings, the needs vary
                according to the function of the space, but they often parallel those listed here.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Wants comprise </h4>
              <p>a large category of luxuries. It is human nature to want to improve one's surroundings and to upgrade
                to nicer, more convenient and beautiful spaces and furnishings. </p>
              <p>The justification is perceived to be an enhanced quality of life. Yet every want or indulgence should
                be weighed against the need it will fulfill and then be compared to the cost it will require—in time,
                effort and money—and the long-term usefulness of that item. The result is common sense, meaning the
                planning of space that meets both needs and wants in a reasonable way.</p>
            </li>

          </ul>

        </div>

        <div id="Function_First">
          <header>
            <h2>Function First</h2>
          </header>

          <p>Functional analysis is perhaps the most important of the space planning criteria. Function means the
            intended use of the space;
          </p>
          <p>It can be graphically illustrated as zones</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Work zones </h4>
              <p>zones include the kitchen, the laundry, and other task areas such as sewing, tool or repair, and craft
                or hobby areas, as well as an area or office for taking care of household organization, bill paying, and
                family scheduling. If a business is conducted at home, the work zone might include a professionally
                equipped home office or, in the case of a “cottage industry,” a place for the manufacture and storage of
                products, perhaps with a separate entrance, if zoning laws permit. The need for employment work space
                may dictate two or more work zones, as separate areas are often required in order to maintain
                professionalism.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Social zones </h4>
              <p>include entryways; formal living and dining spaces; and informal family rooms and dining spaces, great
                rooms, multipurpose or recreation areas, media or home theater rooms; as well as solariums or outdoor
                living spaces. Hallways may be part of the social zones.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Private zones </h4>
              <p>are those allotted for private living: the bedrooms, bathrooms, and private sitting or retreat areas.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Zone within zone </h4>
              <p>may be a feasible solution for specific tasks. For example, a work zone involving a computer may be
                placed in a social zone (living, dining, or family room) because space is available there; this
                arrangement is convenient and doesn't take the user away from the center of family activity. Or a work
                zone may be placed within a private zone. A computer station, for instance, could occupy a corner of a
                bedroom or a private retreat area.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

        <div id="Interrelating_Functions">

          <header>
            <h2>Interrelating Functions</h2>
          </header>
          <p>At this point, a list or “bubble” of the major zones and where they might be duplicated
            could be explored.</p>
          <p>The next task is to determine how many rooms and what specific functions these zones will contain and how
            they will interrelate.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>formal living </h4>
              <p>Typical is the placement of the formal living zone next to the formal dining area.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>The kitchen </h4>
              <p> The kitchen next to the service (laundry, garage, or outside-entry) areas.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>bedrooms</h4>
              <p>And the bedrooms next to the bath-rooms. </p>
            </li>
            <p>Include in the list what areas or functions the user wishes to interrelate. There is great latitude for
              customization in new construction. For example, some clients may request a home office in a private, quiet
              area of the home, while others may want it near the front door or in or near the kitchen. Some prefer the
              family room open to the kitchen and informal dining (a combination known as the great room), while others
              want the informal social zone separated from the kitchen. </p>
            <p>When functions interrelate, or flow smoothly from one zone to another, and when the design program is
              well executed, the result is quality interior design.</p>

          </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="Brainstorming">
          <header>
            <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
          </header>


          <p>Once the basic zones are established, brainstorming exactly what should occupy those zones is next.
            Brainstorming is a useful tool for putting down on paper a list of everything that is needed or wanted in
            each zone. </p>

          <p>Specifics are listed, from the size of the bathtub to the number of places for shoes and sweaters, how
            many people will occupy the entry or the outdoor living space, and where each family member will go for
            solitude. </p>

          <p>In non-residential brainstorming sessions, the zoning ideas will center around work productivity, ease of
            communication, and which functions interrelate. These are also considerations in home planning.</p>

          <p>One important rule of a brainstorming session, no matter how many prospective users participate, is that
            every idea be recorded for further consideration and no one be allowed to say anything negative about
            anyone else's idea, no matter how absurd it may appear. Rather, the rule is to write down every idea, look
            for the needs and wants that it may fulfill, and allow it to spawn even more creativity.</p>

          <p>After brainstorming, which can take place in one or several sessions or can be a posted list to which
            ideas can be added, let some time pass for the ideas to be considered by each work team or family member.
          </p>

          <p>Then begin the process of culling out or discarding the ideas that, after careful thought, are not
            desirable and building on the ones that are feasible and justifiable.</p>
