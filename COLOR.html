      <div id="FUNDAMENTALS_OF_COLOR ">

        <p>Color remains one of the most challenging and contentious aspects of interior
          design. As the painter and color theorist Josef Albers noted, "colors present them-
          selves in continuous flux, constantly related to changing neighbors and changing
          conditions." </p>

        <h2>FUNDAMENTALS OF COLOR </h2>
        <p>Color, fundamentally, is the result of the way in which an object absorbs or reflects the visible
          light in the color spectrum. An object that the eye perceives as red absorbs every color except
          red, which it reflects. White is often described as the reflection of all colors, while black is
          described as the absorption of all colors. </p>

        <h2>Seeing Color</h2>
        <p>Color is a physical phenomenon, and the range of colors stretches far beyond what the human eye
          is capable of perceiving. At either end of the visible spectrum of light
          are the imperceptible infrared and ultraviolet lights. In between is
          "human color space." This model is best observed when light is
          refracted in a prism and the eye identifies the resultant color wave-lengths-whose number is considered
          to
          be around 10 million-as a rainbow. </p>

      <div>
        <p>Many factors influence the way we see color in interior
          design, but the color in our environments comes from
          only two sources:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p> spectral colored light</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>pigment ordyestuffs.</p>
          </li>
        </ol> <br>
        <p> These combine with the physics of light and
          anatomy to allow us to perceive color, the most emotional
          element in interior design.</p>
      </div> <br><br>



      <div id="_color_">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <P>When the light is warm (contains more yellow and less blue spectral colors), more warm hues are
              reflected
              and the object appears more yellow-based.</P>
          </li>

          <li>
            <P>When the light is cool (contains more blue spectrum and less yellow spectrum), colors appear more
              bluish.
            </P>
          </li>

          <li>
            <P>Orientation, or the direction of natural light, means a slant to the spectrum that affects the way
              colors
              appear:</P>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <P>East light is clear and bright.</P>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>North light is clear and cool.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>South light is constant and warm.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>West light is hazy and hot.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Season and climate affect color. Winter has fewer warm wavelengths, and summer has more; hazy or
              cloudy
              conditions screen out warm wavelengths.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Artificial lighting is in some forms nearly full spectrum; these bulbs or lamps are relatively
              costly.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Incandescent lighting contains more warm wave-lengths than cool.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Economy fluorescent lighting contains more cool spectral colors than warm.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Warm fluorescent lighting is closer to full-spectral energy distribution light.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Combustion lighting (candlelight and fi relight) contains more warm wavelengths, although the
              flickering quality is generally darker, making colors appear darker.

        <ul>
          <p>Color, inherently, has temperature. Color can be described as being warm (reds, oranges,
            yellows) or cold (blues, greens). </p>
          <li>
            <p>Neutrals (whites, grays) also have ranges of temperatures.
              Whites can shift in tone from cool to warm, and the change in temperature can enhance and
              tie together a color scheme. Grays, too, have temperature. In the Pantone color system, cool
              grays tend toward blue, while warm grays gradate toward brown. </p>

      <div id="Neutrals_color">
        <h2>Neutrals</h2>
        <p>Neutrals are the families of whites and off-whites, grays, and blacks and off-blacks. Browns and beiges
          are
          also often considered neutrals, even though they are actually neutralized colored hues.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <header>
              <h3>Whites and Off-Whites</h3>
            </header>

            <p>Whites and off-whites give interiors increased visual space. Whitened backgrounds look light,
              spacious,
              and farther away. Furnishings with hues seem cleaner and crisper surrounded by whites. This approach
              is
              effective in retail merchandising, where the product to be sold and the clothing of the customers
              are
              considered part of the color scheme. </p>

            <p>Off-whites are produced by adding other neutrals (gray, black, brown) to white or by mixing color
              and
              neutrals into white. These undertones produce off-whites that may be warm or cool, clean or dirty,
              more
              neutralized or more colored. Thousands of different off-whites are used in today's interiors. They
              are
              seen in paints, wall coverings, textiles, floor coverings, and accessories. It is usually wise to
              avoid
              using off-whites that are not similar in undertone. </p>

            <p>For example, a clear yellowish off-white and a dirty neutralized pinkish off-white will be
              disturbing;
              one will appear as the wrong color. Off-whites with similar warmth, clarity, and color undertones
              will
              blend harmoniously.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <header>
              <h3> Grays</h3>
            </header>

            <p>Grays are achieved by mixing various amounts of black and white, which makes true achromatic
              (no-color)
              grays. Gray is often an ideal background color against which to show other colors. Grays are easily
              colored with other hues to produce a wide variety of pinkish grays, yellowish grays, greenish grays,
              brownish grays, and so on.</p>

            <p>Colored grays need to be carefully matched or blended to be harmonious, and, like off-white, gray
              may
              be rendered cool or warm, depending on the undertones. Warm grays can be welcoming and comforting;
              cool
              grays tend to be cold and uninviting.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <header>
              <h3> Black and Off-Blacks</h3>
            </header>
            <p>Blacks and off-blacks give deep, dark value to the set-off neutrals. Black sharpens and adds
              richness
              to other colors placed next to it. </p>

            <p>Black used generously may create a dramatic and theatrical setting, although it might pro-duce
              feelings
              of depression in some people. Accents of black give richness to interiors. </p>

            <p>Off-blacks may be very dark grays or tinted blacks where the hue is barely discernible and can
              effectively tie into color schemes.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <header>
              <h3>Browns</h3>
            </header>
            <p>Browns and beiges are often favored because of the warm qualities that they bring to an interior.
              Browns are achieved by mixing several colors on the color wheel or by neutralizing orange. Often
              browns
              are introduced into an interior through stained woods, which do not need to match as long as they
              harmonize. </p>

            <p>Used in large amounts, browns can produce either a cave like coziness or a feeling of oppression.
              Browns are often at their peak when good value distribution is employed, utilizing many steps of
              lightness from beige to very dark brown.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Designing rooms in neutrals is not a new idea, nor will it readily be a dated one. Many beautiful
          interiors
          are created using achromatic whites, grays, and blacks, along with the brown/beige group.</p>

        <p> These environments make fi ne backgrounds for colorful artwork and accessories. One major advantage of
          selecting neutrals for interiors is the flexibility to change color schemes without being locked into a
          set
          color.</p>

        <p>Interiors employing neutrals in every room also allow furnishings to be moved from one room to another.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>The simplest of the rules, contrast of hue, functions at the extremes of undiluted colors at the
              greatest luminosity. Solutions that use contrast of hue have a visual vibrancy and playful
              intensity.
              This contrast always requires three colors, and it is important to note that the effect lessens as
              the
              colors move away from Itten's three primaries. </p>

            <h3>Light-Dark Contrast</h3>
            <p>Light-dark contrast exists in the relationship between black and white-as well as in the range of
              grays
              that exist between them. Itten saw gray as

            <h3>Cold-Warm Contrast </h3>
            <p>Particular colors can affect the relative comfort
              of a room at a specific temperature. In fact, a perceptual change in physical temperature occurs
              in spaces when they are painted in cold versus warm colors. For Itten, cold-warm contrasts were
              highly versatile in their expressive powers. </p>

            <h3>Complementary Contrast </h3>
            <p>Complements occur when two hues are mixed
              and the result is a neutral gray-black. (In additive color systems, the result will be white.) Every
              color within a color system has its complement; finding a complementary color is a simple matter
              of selecting opposite colors on Itten's wheel. In complementary contrasts, colors balance each
              other. </p>

            <h3>Simultaneous Contrast </h3>
            <p>Simultaneous contrast occurs as an optical illusion: The complementary color of an applied
              color is not itself objectively present, but appears
              to be visible. Simultaneous contrast requires an adjacent neutral color, or any other color that is
              not complementary. The longer a background is viewed, especially with more luminous colors, the
              greater the intensity of the simultaneous effects. </p>

            <h3>Contrast of Saturation </h3>
            <p>Color can be diluted via four methods to obtain different results: Adding white makes a color
              cooler;
              adding black reduces the overall vitality of a color and renders it more subdued and, in the absence
              of light, quite dark; adding gray reduces the intensity of a color and tends to neutralize it;
              adding
              the complementary color produces various effects, depending on the intensity of the colors being
              mixed,
              their relative temperature, and their hue. </p>

                saturation. Various shades of browns and yellows allow this intervention to fit

                existing architecture also contribute to the
                scheme's success. </figcaption>

            <h3>Contrast of Extension </h3>
            <p>Contrast of extension refers to the relative force that a color exerts in relation to the other
              colors
              in a system. Depending on the hue and value of a color, careful consideration must be taken to
              balance the addition of another color. The result is a ratio that harmonizes the colors in play. Of
              all the contrast rules, this is perhaps the most
              subjective.</p>
