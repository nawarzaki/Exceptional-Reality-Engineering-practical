        <p>Gestalt psychology affirms that the mind will simplify the visual environment in order to understand
          it. Given any composition of forms, we tend to reduce the subject matter in our visual field to
          the simplest and most regular shapes. The simpler and more regular a shape is, the easier it is to
          perceive and understand.</p>

        <p>From geometry we know the regular shapes to be the circle, and the infinite series of regular
          polygone that can be inscribed within it. Of these, the most significant are the primary shapes:
          the circle, the triangle, and the square.</p>

          <li>
            <h4>Circle</h4>
            <p>A plane curve every point of which is equidistant
              from a fixed point within the curve</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Triangle</h4>
            <p> A plane figure bounded by three sides and
              having three angles</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Square</h4>
            <p>A plane figure having four equal sides and four
              right angles</p>

        </header>
        <p>The circle is a centralized, introverted figure that is normally stable
          and self-centering in its environment. Placing a circle in the center of
          a field reinforces its inherent centrality. Associating it with straight
          or angular forms or placing an element along its circumference,
          however, can induce in the circle an apparent rotary motion.</p>

      <div id="TRIANGLE">
        <h2>TRIANGLE</h2>
        <p>The triangle signifies stability. When resting on one of its sides, the triangle is an extremely
          stable figure. When tipped to stand on one of its vertices, however, it can either be balanced in
          a precarious state of equilibrium or be unstable and tend to fall over onto one of its sides.</p>

      <div id="SQUARE">
        <h3>SQUARE</h3>

        <p>The square represents the pure and the rational. It is a bilaterally symmetrical figure having
          two equal and perpendicular axes. All other rectangles can be considered variations of the
          square—deviations from the norm by the addition of height or width.</p>

        <p>Like the triangle,
          the square is stable when resting on one of its sides and dynamic when standing on one of
          its corners. When its diagonals are vertical and horizontal, however, the square exists in a
          balanced state of equilibrium.</p>

      <div id="SURFACES">
        <header>
          <h3>SURFACES</h3>
        </header>
        <p>In the transition from the shapes of planes to the forms of
          volumes is situated the realm of surfaces. Surface first refers to
          any figure having only two dimensions, such as a flat plane. </p>
        <p>The
          term, however, can also allude to a curved two-dimensional locus
          of points defining the boundary of a three-dimensional solid.
          There is a special class of the latter that can be generated from
          the geometric family of curves and straight lines. This class of
          curved surfaces include the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Cylindrical surface are generated by sliding a straight lin
              along a plane curve, or vice versa. Depending on the curve,
              a cylindrical surface may be circular, elliptic, or parabolic.
              Because of its straight line geometry, a cylindrical surface can
              be regarded as being either a translational or a ruled surface.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Translational surfaces are generated by sliding a plane curve
              along a straight line or over another plane curve.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Ruled surface are generated by the motion of a straight
              line. Because of its straight line geometry, a ruled surface is
              generally easier to form and construct than a rotational or
              translational surface.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Rotational surface are generated by rotating a plane curve
              about an axis.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Paraboloids are surface all of whose intersection by planes
              are either parabolas and ellipses or parabolas and hyperbolas.
              Parabolas are plane curves generated by a moving point
              that remains equidistant from a fixed line and a fixed point
              not on the line. Hyperbolas are plane curves formed by the
              intersection of a right circular cone with a plane that cuts
              both halves of the cone.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Hyperbolic paraboloids are surface generated by sliding
              a parabola with downward curvature along a parabola with
              upward curvature, or by sliding a straight line segment with
              its ends on two skew lines. It can thus be considered to be
              both a translational and a ruled surface.</p>
          </li>
          <br>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/form space and order/primary shapes/curved surfaces.jpg" alt="curved surfaces"
              style="height: 40%; width: 40%;">
            <img src="images/form space and order/primary shapes/surfaces curved.jpg" alt="curved surfaces"
              style="height: 40%; width: 40%;">
          </figure><br><br>
        </ul>
        <p>Saddle surfaces have an upward curvature in one
          direction and a downward curvature in the perpendicular
          perpendicular direction. regions of downward curvature behave as a
          action while regions of upward curvature behave as a
          cable structure. If the edges of a saddle surface are not
          supported, beam behavior may also be present.</p>

        <p>The type of structural system that can best take
          advantage of this doubly curved geometry is the shell
          structure—a thin, plate structure, usually of reinforced
          concrete, which is shaped to transmit applied forces by
          compressive, tensile, and shear stresses acting in the
          plane of the curved surface.</p>

          <figcaption>
            <p><b>Restaurant Los Manantiales, Felix Candela. The structure
                consists of a radial arrangement of eight
                hyperbolic paraboloid segments.</b></p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure><br><br>
        <p>Related to shell structures are gridshell structures, which were poineered by the russian engineer vladimir
          shukhov in the late
          19th century. Like shell structures, gridshells
          rely on their double curvature geometry for
          their strength but are constructed of a grid
          or lattice, usually of wood or steel. Gridshells
          are capable of being formed into irregular
          curved surfaces, relying on computer modeling
          programs for their structural analysis and
          optimization and sometimes their fabrication
          and assembly as well.</p>

        <p>The fluid quality of curved surfaces contrasts with the
          angular nature of rectilinear forms and is appropriate for
          describing the form of shell structures as well as non-load-
          bearing elements of enclosure.</p>

        <p>Symmetrical curved surfaces, such as domes and barrel
          vaults, are inherently stable. Asymmetrical curved surfaces,
          on the other hand, can be more vigorous and expressive in
          nature. Their shapes change dramatically as we view them
          from different perspectives.</p>
