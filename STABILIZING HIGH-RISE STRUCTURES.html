      <h3>Rigid Frame Structures</h3>

      <p>One of the primary and predominant structural systems
        employed for tall steel and concrete buildings through the
        1960s was the conventional rigid frame. The structural
        framework represents a vertical cantilever beam with a
        fixed base at the ground.</p>

      <p>Wind and earthquake loads are assumed to act laterally,
        generating shear and bending moments in addition to the
        vertical gravity loads. The floor framing system usually
        carries almost the same gravity loads at each floor but the
        girders along the column lines need to be progressively
        heavier toward the base of the building to resist the
        increasing lateral forces and to augment the building's
        stiffness.</p>

      <p>Column sizes increase progressively toward the base of
        the building due to the accumulated increase in gravity
        loads transmitted from the floors above. Additionally, the
        columns toward the base need to be increased further to
        resist the accumulating lateral loads. The net result is that
        as a building's height increases and its sway from lateral
        forces becomes critical, there is a greater demand placed
        on the columns and girders that make up the rigid frame
        system to carry the lateral forces.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/High Rise Structures/Rigid Frame Structures.png" alt="HIGH RISE STRUCTURES"
          style="height: 24%; width: 24%;">

          <p><b>Rigid Frame Structures</b></p>
        </figcaption>
      </figure> <br><br>

      <p>In rigid frame construction, the beams and girders
        spanning in both directions must be stiff enough to
        minimize the shear-racking or drift of the high-rise floors.
        This generally requires additional material for the beams
        and girders unless the floor drift can be controlled by other
        vertical elements, such as shear walls or structural cores.
        The quantity of materials required for resisting lateral
        loads could increase to such a degree that rigid frame
        systems would become cost-prohibitive for use in buildings
        exceeding 30 stories in height.</p>

      <p>Vertical steel shear trusses or concrete shear walls alone
        are effective in providing lateral resistance for buildings
        from 10 to 35 stories high. However, when shear walls or
        shear trusses are combined with rigid, moment-resisting
        frames, the interaction of the two lateral-force-resisting
        systems can produce greater lateral rigidity for the building
        and increase its capability to rise as high as 60 stories.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/High Rise Structures/Rigid Frame Structures 2.jpg"
          alt="HIGH RISE STRUCTURES" style="height: 24%; width: 24%;">
        <figcaption>
          <p><b>Rigid Frame Structures</b></p>
        </figcaption>
      </figure> <br><br>

      <p>The vertical circulation cores for elevators and emergency
        egress stairways are usually constructed of reinforced
        concrete or braced steel frames, enabling them to be used as
        a major component of the gravity and lateral-force-resisting
        strategy for multistory buildings. The placement of the shear-
        resisting core is critical in minimizing the possibility of torsion
        due to lateral loads. A relatively symmetrical placement of
        structural cores and braced frames or shear walls can alleviate
        the eccentricity between the center of mass of a diaphragm
        level and the center of rigidity or resistance.</p>

      <p>Regardless of core location, the preferred lateral resistance
        system is of the closed type, with the bracing or frame action
        forming a complete tube. Examples of this are tubular framed
        towers with continuous, moment-connected spandrels and
        columns around the building perimeter; braced cores with
        the core sides stiffened by diagonals or knee braces; and
        structural concrete cores with heavily reinforced lintel beams
        over doorways acting as links between wall segments. These
        closed forms are preferred because of their inherent torsional
        stiffness.</p>

      <p>High-rise structures may contain a single or multiple cores.
        Large single-core structures may support cantilevered
        floor structures, or be combined with a top-hat structure or
        intermediate outriggers to provide column-free spaces at each
        floor level.</p>

        <h2>Braced Frames</h2>
      </header>

      <p>Braced-frame structures use vertical trusses to resist
        the lateral loads in tall buildings. These vertical trusses
        use the perimeter columns as chord members and K-,
        V-, or X-braces as web members, effectively eliminating
        bending in the columns under lateral loading.</p>

      <p>The columns,
        girders, and diagonal bracing can be simply connected
        with pin joints, making their fabrication and erection
        more economical than the moment-resisting connections
        required for rigid frame structures.</p>

      <p>The diagonal bracing
        increases the structure's stiffness, moderates drift, and
        enables greater overall heights. Braced frames are
        generally used in conjunction with other lateral-force-
        resisting systems for taller buildings.</p>

      <p>Eccentrically braced frames use diagonal braces that
        are connected to the floor girders that form horizontal
        elements of the truss. The eccentricity of the axial offsets
        introduce bending and shear into the frame, lowering the
        stiffness of the frame but increasing its ductility, which
        is an advantage in seismic zones where ductility is an
        important requirement for structural design. Eccentrically
        braced frames also have the ability to accommodate wide
        door and window openings in their plane.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/High Rise Structures/Braced Frames.png" alt="HIGH RISE STRUCTURES"
          style="height: 24%; width: 39%;">
        <figcaption>
          <p><b>Braced Frames</b></p>
        </figcaption>
      </figure> <br><br>

      <p>If the diagonal bracing members increase in scale to cross
        several floor levels, the system falls closer to the category
        of a megaframe structure.</p>

      <br><br>

      <header>
        <h2>Shear Walls</h2>
      </header>

      <p>Shear wall systems are often used for high-rise structures
        to provide the necessary strength and stiffness to resist
        the lateral forces caused by wind and earthquakes.
        Generally constructed of reinforced concrete, the shear
        walls are relatively thin and tend to have relatively high
        (height-to-width) aspect ratios.</p>

      <p>Shear walls are treated as vertical cantilevers fixed at their
        base. When two or more shear walls in the same plane
        are connected by beams or slabs, as in the case of shear
        walls with window and door openings, the total stiffness
        of the system can exceed the sum of the individual wall
        stiffnesses. This occurs because the connecting beam
        forces the walls to act as a single unit (like a large rigid
        frame) by restraining the individual cantilever actions.
        When designed to act as a unit, the assembly is known as
        a coupled shear wall.</p>

      <header>
        <h2>Tube Structures</h2>
      </header>

      <p>A framed-tube structure utilizes the entire building
        perimeter to resist lateral loads. The basic tubular structure
        is best viewed as a hollow, cantilevered box beam fixed
        at the ground level, with exterior frames constructed of
        closely spaced columns rigidly connected to deep spandrel
        beams. Previous examples of framed-tube systems, like
        the former World Trade Center Towers, used columns
        spaced from 4 to 15 feet (1.2 to 4.6 m) on center and
        spandrel beams from 2 to 4 feet (610 to 1220) deep.</p>

      <p>The tube can be rectangular, circular, or other relatively
        regular shape. Since the exterior walls resist all or most of
        the lateral loads, much or all of the interior diagonals and
        shear walls are eliminated. The stiffness of the facade can
        be further enhanced by adding diagonal braces to create a
        trussing action.</p>

      <p>When a building bends as a cantilever beam would under
        lateral loading, the racking of the structural frame causes
        an uneven distribution of axial column loads. The corner
        columns experience larger loads and the distribution is
        nonlinear from each corner toward the middle.</p>

      <p>Since the
        framed tube's behavior is somewhere between that of a
        pure cantilever and a pure frame, the sides of the tube
        parallel to the lateral load tend to act as independent
        multibay rigid frames due to the flexibility of the columns
        and spandrel beams. This causes the columns toward the
        middle of the frames to lag behind those near the corners,
        unlike the behavior of a true tube. This phenomenon is
        known as shear lag.</p>

      <figure>

          <p><b>Tube Structures</b></p>
        </figcaption>
      </figure> <br><br>

      <p>Designers have developed various techniques for reducing
        the effects of shear lag. Among these, the most notable
        is the use of belt trusses. Belt trusses are placed on the
        exterior wall planes, often at mechanical floors, to assist
        in equalizing the tension and compression forces due to
        shear lag.</p>

        <h2>Tube-in-Tube Structures</h2>
      </header>

      <p>The stiffness of framed tubes can be improved
        considerably by using a structural core to not only resist
        gravity loads but to resist lateral loads as well. The floor
        diaphragms tie the exterior and interior tubes together,
        allowing the two tubes to resist lateral forces as a unit.
        This system is known as a tube-in-tube structure.</p>

      <p>The exterior tube, with its larger plan dimensions, can
        resist the overturning forces quite efficiently, however, the
        openings required in this tube compromise its capacity
        to resist shear, particularly at the lower levels. On the
        other hand, the solidity of the inner tube, which can be
        constructed of shear walls, braced frames, or moment
        frames, can better resist the story shear.</p>

      <header>
        <h2>Braced-Tube Structures</h2>
      </header>

      <p>An inherent weakness of framed-tube structures lies in
        the flexibility of their spandrel beams. Framed tubes can
        be stiffened by adding large diagonals to the exterior
        wall frame, as at the 100-story John Hancock Center in
        Chicago. When diagonals are added to a framed-tube
        structure, it is called a braced-tube structure.</p>

      <p>The large diagonal braces together with the spandrel
        beams create a wall-like rigidity against lateral loads.
        This stiffening of the perimeter frames overcomes the
        shear lag problem faced by framed-tube structures.
        The diagonals support lateral load forces primarily through
        axial action and also act as inclined columns in resisting
        gravity floor loads, allowing the exterior columns to be
        spaced farther apart.</p>

      <figure>

        <h2>Bundled-Tube Structures</h2>
      </header>

      <p>A bundled-tube structure is a cluster of individual tubes
        tied together to act as a single unit. Single framed tubes
        are restricted in height by their slenderness (height-to-
        width ratio). Combining several tubes to act in unison
        with each other adds considerably to their stiffness
        and moderates the sway at the upper floors. A special
        weakness of this system is the differential column
        shortening.</p>

      <p>Chicago's 110-story Sears Tower, designed by SOM,
        consists of nine framed steel tubes, each with its own
        structural integrity. Because each of the individual tubes
        are independently strong with respect to wind load, they
        can be bundled into varying configurations and terminated
        at various levels. Only two of the modules rise to the full
        1450-foot (440-meter) height of the structure.</p>

      <p>Two drop
        off at the 50th floor, two more at the 66th, and three at
        the 90th. Dropping off modules reduces wind sway by
        breaking the flow of the wind. The nine modules are each
        75 by 75 feet (22 by 22 meters) square and have common
        interior columns that make up two diaphragms trisecting
        the building in two directions and thereby stiffening the
        structure. The interior diaphragms act as webs of a huge
        cantilever beam in resisting shear forces, thus minimizing
        shear lag.</p>

        <h2>Space-Truss Structures</h2>
      </header>

      <p>A space-truss structure is a modified braced tube based
        on the idea of stacking triangulated prisms which contain
        diagonals connecting the exterior with the interior frame.
        The space truss resists both lateral and vertical loads.
        Unlike the more typical braced-tube structure with
        diagonals placed on the exterior wall planes, the space-
        truss system introduces diagonals that become an integral
        part of the interior space.</p>

      <p>A prominent example of a space-truss system is the
        72-story Bank of China Building in Hong Kong, designed by
        I.M. Pei, consisting of triangular prisms of different heights,
        which transfers internal loads to the building corners at
        13-story intervals. The space truss resists the lateral loads
        and transfers almost the entire weight of the building onto
        the four super-columns at the corners.</p>

        <h2>Megaframe Structures</h2>
      </header>

      <p>As buildings rise above the 60-story range, megaframe
        or superframe structures become a viable possibility.
        Megaframe structures use megacolumns comprising the
        chords of oversized braced frames at the building corners,
        which are linked by multistory trusses at 15- to 20-story
        intervals; these are often the mechanical floor levels. </p>

      <p>The entire story depth of the mechanical floors can be
        used to construct a strong and stiff horizontal subsystem.
        Linking these very large girders or space trusses to the
        megacolumns produces a rigid megaframe that can be
        infilled with a lighter secondary frame of standard design.</p>

        <h2>Diagrid Structures</h2>
      </header>

      <p>A fairly recent application of a lattice-like framework on
        the exterior surface of the building to resist both lateral
        and gravity loads is the diagrid (diagonal grid) system.
        Diagrid structures differ from conventional braced frames
        in their ability to resist gravity loads, which is so effective
        that vertical columns are virtually eliminated.</p>

      <p>The diagonal members in the diagrid system carry both
        gravity and lateral loads through triangulation, which
        results in a relatively uniform load distribution. Shear
        deformation is minimized very effectively because the
        diagonals resist the shear through axial action rather than
        by bending of vertical columns and horizontal spandrels.
        Diagrids provide both shear and bending rigidity to resist
        the effects of drift and overturning moment. Diagrid
        systems are also highly redundant and can transfer loads
        through multiple paths in case of a localized structural
        failure.</p>

      <ul>
        <p>The most common structural material used in diagrids
          is steel. Because of their structural efficiency, diagrids
          generally require less steel than other types of high-rise
          structures.</p>

        <li>
          <p>The diagrid structural system can accommodate a
            variety of open floor plans. Beside the service core,
            the typical floor plan can be free of columns and other
            structural elements.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Design studies indicate that using variable-angle
            diagrids for very tall buildings with height:width aspect
            ratios over 7 results in structural efficiency. However,
            using uniform-angle diagrids for buildings with
            height:width ratios lower than 7 reduces the amount of
            steel required.</p>
        </li>

        <p>The Hearst Tower has 46 stories, stands 597 feet (182 m)
          tall, and contains 860,000 sf (80,000 m2) of office space.
          Because the triangulated three-dimensional form of the
          steel diagrid structure is capable of both supporting gravity
          loads and resisting lateral wind forces, there is no need for
          exterior vertical columns. The diagrid structure reportedly
          used 20% less steel than a conventionally framed high-rise
          of similar size.</p>

        <p>30 St. Mary Axe—informally known as The Gherkin and
          previously, the Swiss Re Building—is a skyscraper in
          London's financial district. With 41 floors, the tower is
          591 feet (180 m) tall and stands on the site of the former
          Baltic Exchange, which was extensively damaged in 1992
          by the explosion of a bomb placed by the Provisional IRA.
          After plans to build the Millennium Tower were dropped,
          30 St. Mary Axe was erected, soon becoming an iconic
          symbol of London and one of the city's more widely
          recognized examples of modern architecture.</p>

        <p>The shape of the tower was partially influenced by the
          need to have a smooth flow of wind around the building
          and minimize its impact on the local wind environment.
          Across this curved surface the diagrid structure is formed
          by generating a pattern of intersecting diagonals spiraling
          in two directions.</p>

        <p>The unusual geometry of the tower gives rise to
          significant horizontal forces at each node level where
          the diagonal columns intersect, which are resisted by
          perimeter hoops. As with dome structures, the hoops in
          the upper region are in compression while those at the
          middle and lower levels are subject to significant tensile
          forces. The hoops also serve to transform the diagrid into
          a very stiff triangulated shell, freeing the interior core
          from the need to resist lateral wind forces. Foundation
          loads are also reduced when compared with a high-rise
          structure stabilized by its core.</p>

        <p>This elevation represents the most recent redesign
          of Tower Verre—a slender, 75-story steel-framed
          skyscraper that is shorter than the originally planned
          1050-foot (320-m), 78 story high-rise. As opposed to the
          regular geometry of both the Hearst Tower and St. Mary
          Axe, Tower Verre uses an irregular diagrid structure to
          compose its faceted exterior that tapers to a set of three
          distinct asymmetrical, crystalline peaks at the apex of
          the tower.</p>
