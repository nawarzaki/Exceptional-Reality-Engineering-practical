        <p>Floor plans are part of the working drawings or documents required to build a new space or remodel an
          existing one. A custom floor plan may evolve slowly by hand,
          beginning with a bubble and then overlay through steps of refinement, or drafting may be accomplished
          with
          computer software tools.
          Stock plans can be edited or modified or can be left as is, with the home built from readily available
          plans.</p>

          <p>Calculation of square metric and cubic metric. </p>
          <li>
            <p>Square metric is derived by multiplying the width of a room by its length. The 3 metre by 4 metre
              yields 12 square metre. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Cubic metric is the width multiplied by the length and then by the height of the room. The 30
              square
              metric multiplied by 2.8-metre walls yields 84 cubic metre.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The same room with a 4-metre ceiling contains more cubic metre and will cost more in both material
              and labor, even though the square metric remains the same.</p>

              <p> (A) Square footage is derived by multiplying the width of a room

              <p>(B) Cubic footage is the width multiplied by the length and then
                by the height of the room. The 100 square feet multiplied by

          <h3>Shaping the Space</h3>
        </header>
        <p>The shape of the interior space has horizontal and vertical components. Although a rectangular room is
          the
          easiest to build and simplest to decorate, it can also be the most boring architecturally.</p>

        <p>Angled or curved walls, vaulted or curved ceilings, half walls or transparent walls, or even cutout
          sections between rooms can add interest and visually expand the actual dimensions of the room. </p>

        <p>Altering room shapes has been a boon to new smaller homes and to the remodeling of older ones, as the
          alternatives give the impression of greater space and provide architectural interest where none may
          otherwise have existed.</p>

        <p>he shape of interior spaces can also affect the exterior shape and dimensions of the home; this, too,
          must
          be taken into careful consideration when designing custom housing.</p>

        <p>From the interior living standpoint, it is ideal to first determine the spatial arrangements and shapes
          within the floor plan, then let the exterior shape be determined by the sizes and shapes of the interior
          spaces. However, the desired style or proportions of the exterior will often limit or restrict the
          interior
          shapes or sizes. </p>

        <p>Realistically, some compromise is often necessary. A room may need to be altered in dimension or size
          to
          make the exterior more pleasing, or the placement of doors and windows in the rooms may be dictated by
          their
          fenestration, or arrangement, from the exterior.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/Floor Plans and Building Systems/shape of this Modern style.png"
            alt="shape of this Modern style" style="height:56% ;width:39%">
          <figcaption>The shape of this Modern-style informal dining area was planned to
            take advantage of a sweeping wood and waterfront view. The bow window accommodates a custom-built
            bench
            and ledge ideal for leaning on while using the binoculars.</figcaption>

        <header>
          <h3>Site, Orientation, and Climate</h3>
        </header>

        <p>The shape of the space may also be dictated by the limitations or special considerations of the
          building
          site. </p>

        <p>Look carefully at the direction of the prevailing breezes in both summer and winter, the slope of the
          lot,
          any natural vegetation, the location and types of nearby buildings, and property values of surrounding
          architecture.</p>

        <p>Also consider the orientation, or direction the site faces, so that solar aspects and fenestration can
          be
          incorporated. The orientation is also important in relation to the climate. A sunbelt home will have
          different planning than a New England home, for example, because the former must provide control of heat
          from the sun and the latter must control excessive winter cold. The needs and criteria of the climate,
          then,
          are important aspects of planning a home.</p>

        <h3>Floor Plan Types</h3>
        <p>There are three types of floor plans: </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>A closed floor plan is one in which most or all of the rooms are units that are opened to others
              only
              by a door, and when the door is shut, the room is completely enclosed. This gives privacy and
              control
              over sound, yet often it creates a chopped-up floor plan without flexibility.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>An open floor plan has several areas that are open to one another without walls or with only
              partial
              walls or dividers. The cost to build may be less, and the space seems much larger than with a closed
              plan. There is flexibility in the use of the space. The disadvantages lie in the lack of privacy
              that
              may result and the transmission of more sound than is desirable. These floor plans may open
              vertically
              (high ceilings), horizontally (few walls), or both.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Combination (open and closed) plans have both open and closed areas or areas that can be opened to
              permit a flexible use of the space. This can be accomplished with double doors (such as a pair of
              pocket
              sliding doors, French doors, or accordion doors) and with some areas with high ceilings that open to
              areas such as lofts or balconies or other living space.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Types of Housing</h3>

        <p>Housing can be divided into two broad categories:</p>

        <p> the single family residence (SFR), which is an
          independent house with a yard, </p>

        <p> and attached dwellings, those that share walls, with or without a yard.</p>

        <ul>
          <h3>The Single Family Residence</h3>
          <p>The single family residence, or a home with a yard, has the greatest potential for individuality.
            Although some are rental units, the majority of homes are owner occupied. Ownership means that the
            plan
            can be originated or remodeled to fit the needs of the owners. Here are the types of plans:</p>

          <li>
            <p>A rambler, or ranch. A one-story home, with living room, dining room, kitchen, bedrooms, and
              bathroom
              all on one level. A basement, if any, typically contains a family room, utility area (laundry,
              half-bath, and mudroom), additional bedrooms, bathroom, and/or storage. When built with a slope in
              the
              backyard, the downstairs area may be a walk-out basement, which allows for full-size windows and
              patio
              doors.</p>

            <figure>
              <img src="images/Floor Plans and Building Systems/rambler or ranch style plan.png"
                alt="rambler or ranch style plan" style="height:36% ;width:60%">
              <figcaption>A rambler or ranch-style plan with optional basement.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>In this case, a deck and perhaps steps down to the backyard will service the main floor. A rambler
              can
              be a pre-fabricated house moved onto the site and placed on a waiting foundation or over a basement;
              such homes are also built in developments ranging from modest to upscale and may even be spacious
              with
              luxury features.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>One-and-one-half story. A plan with bedrooms upstairs inside the attic, usually with dormer
              windows.
              The main floor contains the living and dining rooms, kitchen, bath or half-bath, and perhaps a den
              or
              family room and/or master bedroom.</p>

            <figure>
              <img src="images/Floor Plans and Building Systems/one and one half story plan.jpg"
                alt="one and one half story plan" style="height:50% ; width:80%">

                The upper ﬂoor includes a bonus room.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Two-story. A plan similar to a one-and-one-half story, except that the roof line begins above the
              second floor, allowing full-height ceilings. There is usually a full- or partial-height attic above
              the
              second floor.</p>

            <figure>
              <img src="images/Floor Plans and Building Systems/two story plan.jpg" alt="two story plan"
                style="height:50% ; width:80%">

                areas
                are zoned upstairs. </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Split level. A house with three or more levels. Typical plans put the living room, dining room,
              kitchen, and perhaps a half-bath on the main floor. Up one-half flight is the bedroom wing, and down
              one-half flight from the entry is the family room and utility space. Another level below the main
              floor
              may house storage or extra bedrooms.</p>

            <figure>
              <img src="images/Floor Plans and Building Systems/split level home.png" alt="split level home"
                style="height:39% ;width:60% ;">
              <figcaption>A split-level home showing three steps down to the family room and ten steps up to the
                bedroom wing above the garage.

            </figure>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Split entry or raised ranch. A rambler with a raised basement, where half the basement is above
              ground
              level. The entry is on a landing, and stairs go up to the main floor or down to the basement. Being
              half-way above ground level, the basement is better-lit with larger windows, making the lower level
              a
              more livable space.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Patio home. A plan suitable for a narrow lot. It may be one, one-and-one-half, or two stories. Such
              homes are economical because of the modest number of square feet and smaller lot size. One-story
              patio
              homes are especially well suited to the retirement-age owner who does not want to or cannot climb
              stairs. Patio homes are also a good choice for first or starter homes.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Mobile home. A prefabricated home that is a part of a mobile home park. Single-wide mobile homes
              are
              3.60- to 4.60 metre wide; double-wide mobile homes are 6.10- to 9.15 metre wide and are fabricated
              as
              two units
              and moved to the site. Originally called trailers, and meant to be mobile, most of these are now
              permanent.</p>

          <h3>Attached Dwellings</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Attached dwellings have many advantages: better use of land so that more people can live in locations
          convenient to urban centers, schools, or business; less cost; and more freedom from the yardwork and
          upkeep
          that a larger home and yard require. Their major categories are as follows:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Apartment buildings are multistory buildings where multiple units are housed on each floor,
              accessed by
              stairs and in high-rise complexes also by elevators. Apartments typically have one living area, one
              kitchen/dining area, one or two bathrooms, and one to four bedrooms.</p>

            <p>Multiplex units are small apartment buildings. A two-family or two-unit building is a duplex, which
              may
              be one level with a basement apartment or may be side-by-side apartments. A three-unit building is a
              triplex, a four-unit building is a fourplex or quadplex, and so on. Each unit may have a separate or
              shared entrance.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Accessory apartments are located in a separate dwelling in a portion of the home, such as in the
              basement, in the back of the house, over the garage, or in an up-stairs location. Many locales have
              zoning restrictions on accessory apartments; they will often require, for example, at least three
              off-street parking spaces.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Twin homes (also called semidetached houses) are two homes built on a lot with a shared wall
              between
              them. They may be one, one-and-one-half, or two stories high. These homes may also be called
              duplexes.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Luxury apartments or flats are usually larger and have more upscale or luxury features. The bottom
              or
              ground floor and nearby buildings typically have all the support services required for convenient
              living: parking spaces, a post office, grocery and apparel stores, a drugstore, dry cleaners, and so
              on.
              The living space is called a suite, a flat, a condominium, or an apartment.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Town houses and row houses (also called “brown-stones”) are attached city houses built as a series
              or
              development. They are narrow, usually only one or two rooms wide, and two, three, or four stories
              high.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Flats are a group of rooms on one level of a building, such as an apartment or luxury high-rise
              suite.
              When larger brownstones are subdivided, each unit is often called a flat.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Pied-à-terre is a French term for a flat or house for occasional use (literally, 'foot on the
              ground'),
              typically kept as a second home in a city distant from the primary dwelling.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Note: These terms may vary regionally.</h3>

          <h2>Buying an Existing Home</h2>
        </header>

        <p>Most people will not build a custom home but will purchase or rent an existing one. Although the list
          of
          things to know when selecting a home is extensive and more information is available through the Web
          addresses listed on the Interiors website, here are a few important considerations:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Location, location, and location are said to be the three most important criteria in buying a home.
              It
              is wise to buy the most modest home in a nice neighbor-hood (increased value) but unwise to own the
              nicest home in any neighborhood (decreased value). </p>

            <p>Location has to do with neighborhood, proximity to support services, ease of access, and things
              like
              view and property values.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Buy a home that meets your present and future needs. If you expect to increase or decrease your
              family
              size, operate a home business, or add luxury features, choose a plan that will allow modifications
              without major remodeling.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Consider upkeep. You'll never regret buying a home with materials and systems that are relatively
              maintenance free.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Look for warranties on the environmental control systems (heating, air-conditioning, plumbing, and
              electrical).</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Check for structural soundness in construction-framing, roofing, walls and windows, doors,
              flooring.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Be aware of defects or potential problems; negotiate with the seller as to who will repair existing
              problems. </p>

            <p>Older homes require more upkeep; be sure your bud-get will allow for this. A building inspector
              will
              verify if the home is soundly built and safe for occupancy. In addition, prospective buyers can hire
              private home inspection services to evaluate the building and its systems and fixtures. The findings
              of
              the inspection help buyers decide if the home is worth the asking price. </p>

            <p>Some defects are serious, others are just cosmetic, and still others are perceived defects because
              the
              plan or features do not suit the lifestyle of the new occupants. Go in with your eyes wide open
              about
              what will be required to make the home truly yours.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Utilize online real estate services—both listings and virtual tours. A photo bubble allows viewers
              to
              look up-ward to the ceiling and down at the floor and to pan right and left. As rooms are strung
              together, the Internet tour re-creates a walking tour. Also available are views outside to see the
              neighborhood and the backyard.</p>
