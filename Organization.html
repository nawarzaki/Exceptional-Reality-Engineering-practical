      <p>". . . A good house is a single thing, as well as a collection of many, and
        to make it requires a conceptual leap from the individual components
        to a vision of the whole. The choices â€¦ represent ways of assembling
        the parts.
        . . . the basic parts of a house can be put together to make more than
        just basic parts: They can also make space, pattern, and outside
        domains. They dramatize the most elementary act which architecture
        has to perform. To make one plus one equal more than two, you must in
        doing any one thing you think important (making rooms, putting them
        together, or fitting them to the land) do something else that you think
        important as well (make spaces to live, establish a meaningful pattern
        inside, or claim other realms outside)." </p>

    <div id="SPACE_WITHIN_A_SPACE">
      <h3>SPACE WITHIN A SPACE</h3>
      <p>A large space can envelop and contain a smaller space
        within its volume. Visual and spatial continuity between
        the two spaces can be easily accommodated, but
        the smaller, contained space depends on the larger,
        enveloping space for its relationship to the exterior
        environment.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/form space and order/SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS/SPACE WITHIN.png" alt="SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS"
          style="height: 24%; width: 42%;">
      </figure> <br><br>

      <p>In this type of spatial relationship, the larger, enveloping
        space serves as a three-dimensional field for the smaller
        space contained within it. For this concept to be perceived, a clear differentiation in size is necessary
        between the two spaces. If the contained space were to increase
        in size, the larger space would begin to lose its impact as
        an enveloping form. If the contained space continued to
        grow, the residual space around it would become too compressed to serve as an enveloping space. It would
        become instead merely a thin layer or skin around the contained
        space. The original notion would be destroyed.</p>

      <figure>

          style="height: 24%; width: 48%;">
      </figure> <br><br>

      <p>To endow itself with a higher attention-value, the
        contained space may share the form of the enveloping
        shape, but be oriented in a different manner. This would
        create a secondary grid and a set of dynamic, residual
        spaces within the larger space.</p>

      </figure> <br><br>

      <p>The contained space may also differ in form from the
        enveloping space in order to strengthen its image as a
        freestanding volume. This contrast in form may indicate
        a functional difference between the two spaces or the
        symbolic importance of the contained space.</p>

        <h3>INTERLOCKING SPACES</h3>
      </header>

      <p>An interlocking spatial relationship results from the
        overlapping of two spatial fields and the emergence of a
        zone of shared space. When two spaces interlock their
        volumes in this manner, each retains its identity and
        definition as a space. But the resulting configuration
        of the two interlocking spaces is subject to a number
        of interpretations.</p>

      </figure> <br><br>


      <p>The interlocking portion of the two volumes can be

        <h3>ADJACENT SPACES</h3>
      </header>
      <p>Adjacency is the most common type of spatial relation-
        ship. It allows each space to be clearly defined and to
        respond, each in its own way, to specific functional or
        symbolic requirements. The degree of visual and spatial
        continuity that occurs between two adjacent spaces
        depends on the nature of the plane that both separates
        and binds them together.</p>

      <p>Two spaces that are separated by distance can be
        linked or related to each other by a third, intermediate,
        space. The visual and spatial relationship between the

        with which they share a common bond.</p>

      <p>The intermediate space can differ in form and

      </figure> <br><br>

      <p>The two spaces, as well as the intermediate space,
