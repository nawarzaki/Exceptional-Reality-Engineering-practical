      <h2>Curtain Walls</h2>
    </header>

    <p>Curtain walls are exterior walls supported wholly by the steel
      or concrete structural frame of a building and carrying no loads
      other than their own weight and lateral loads. A curtain wall
      cannot contribute to the stability of the structure.</p>

    <p>A curtain wall may consist of metal framing holding either
      vision glass or opaque spandrel units, or of thin veneer panels
      of precast concrete, cut stone, masonry, or metal. The wall
      units may be one, two, or three stories in height, and may
      be preglazed or glazed after installation. Panel systems offer
      controlled shop assembly and rapid erection, but are bulky to
      ship and handle.</p>

    <p>While simple in theory, curtain wall construction is complex
      and requires careful development, testing, and erection. Close
      coordination is also required between the architect, structural
      engineer, contractor, and a fabricator who is experienced in
      curtain wall construction.</p>

    <ul>
      <p>As with other exterior walls, a curtain
        wall must be able to withstand the
        following elements:</p>

      <h3>Loads</h3>

      <li>
        <p>Curtain walls must be capable of
          carrying their own weight as well as
          resisting lateral wind forces.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>The curtain wall panels must be
          adequately supported by the structural
          frame.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Any deflection or deformation of the
          structural frame under loading should
          not be transferred to the curtain wall.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Seismic design requires the use of
          energy-absorbing connections.</p>
      </li>

      <figure>

        <figcaption>
          <p><b>Curtain Walls</b></p>
        </figcaption>
      </figure> <br><br>

      <h3>Wind</h3>

      <li>
        <p>Wind can create both positive and
          negative pressure on a wall, depending
          on its direction and the shape and
          height of the building.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>The wall must be able to transfer any
          wind loads to the structural frame
          of the building without excessive
          deflection. Wind-induced movement of
          the wall should be anticipated in the
          design of its joints and connections.</p>
      </li>

      <h2>
        Sun
      </h2>

      <li>
        <p>Brightness and glare should be controlled with shading
          devices or the use of reflective or tinted glass.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>The ultraviolet rays of the sun can also cause
          deterioration of joint and glazing materials and fading of
          interior furnishings.</p>
      </li>

      <h2>Temperature</h2>

      <li>
        <p> Daily and seasonal variations in temperature cause
          expansion and contraction of the materials comprising
          a wall assembly, especially metals. Allowance must
          be made for differential movement caused by the
          variable thermal expansion and contraction of different
          materials.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Joints and sealants must be able to withstand the
          movement caused by thermal stresses.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Heat flow through glazed curtain walls should be
          controlled by using insulating glass, insulating opaque
          panels, and by incorporating thermal breaks into metal
          frames.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Thermal insulation of veneer panels may also be
          incorporated into the wall units, attached to their
          backsides, or provided with a backup wall constructed
          on site.</p>
      </li>

      <figure>

        </figcaption>
      </figure> <br><br>

      <h2>Water</h2>

      <li>
        <p>Rain can collect on the wall surface and be wind-driven
          under pressure through the smallest openings.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Water vapor that condenses and collects within the wall
          must be drained to the outside.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Pressure-equalized design principles become critical in
          the detailing of curtain walls, especially in larger and
          taller buildings, where the pressure differential between
          the outside atmosphere and an interior environment can
          cause rainwater to migrate through even the smallest
          openings in wall joints.</p>
      </li>

      <h2>Fire</h2>

      <li>
        <p>A noncombustible material, sometimes referred to as
          safing, must be installed to prevent the spread of fire at
          each floor within column covers and between the wall
          panels and the slab edge or spandrel beam.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>The building code also specifies the fire-resistance
          requirements for the structural frame and the curtain
          wall panels themselves.</p>
      </li>

      <figure>
        <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/Bearing Walls/Curtain Walls 4.jpg" alt="VERTICAL DIMENSIONS"
          style="height: 24%; width: 45%;">

      </figure> <br><br>

    </ul>


    <ul>

      <p>The curtain wall assembly must incorporate members that
        span either horizontally between columns or vertically
        between floors. While spanning horizontally from column
        to column is possible, the spans dictated by the column
        spacing of the structural frame are usually much greater
        than the floor-to-floor heights. For this reason, curtain wall
        systems typically span vertically from floor to floor and are
        suspended from steel or concrete spandrel beams or from
        the edge of cantilevered concrete slabs.</p>

      <p>The primary spanning members of a curtain wall assembly
        may be aluminum extrusions, smaller steel channels and
        angles, or light-gauge metal framing. In panelized curtain
        walls, the spanning members form the strong-back that
        allows that panel to be handled as a unit.</p>

      <p>If desired, secondary framing perpendicular to the primary
        spanning members can subdivide the module of the curtain
        wall design into smaller parts and incorporate a variety
        of devices that serve varying functions, such as opaque,
        insulated panels, operable windows for natural ventilation,
        and louvers or other sunscreening devices.</p>

      <li>
        <p>Structural mullions in the form of extruded aluminum
          sections or structural steel shapes are either hung
          from or supported on spandrel beams or the edges of
          concrete slabs</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Lightweight infill may be glazing
          units, ventilating windows, opaque
          or translucent panels, or a variety of
          sunscreening devices.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>A backup wall contains the thermal
          insulation, vapor retarder, electrical
          wiring, and HVAC equipment.</p>
      </li>

      <figure>

      <li>
        <p>When the vertical spans for a glazed
          curtain wall system increase to the
          point where the structural mullions
          would become too large, as in large
          lobby spaces, three-dimensional
          trusses can be used.</p>
      </li>
    </ul> <br><br>

    <p>There are a variety of metal devices that may be used to
      secure a curtain wall to the structural frame of a building.
      Some connections are fixed to resist loads applied from
      any direction. Others are designed to resist only lateral
      wind loads. These joints typically permit adjustment
      in three dimensions in order to allow for discrepancies
      between the dimensions of the curtain wall units and
      the structural frame, as well as to accommodate the
      differential movement when the structural frame deflects
      under loading or when the curtain wall reacts to thermal
      stresses and changes in temperature.</p>

    <p>Shim plates and angles with slotted holes allow
      adjustments to be made in one direction; a combination
      of angles and plates allows adjustments to be made in
      three dimensions. After final adjustments are made, the
      connections can be permanently secured by welding if a
      fixed connection is required.</p>

      <h2>Relation of Curtain Wall to Structural Frame</h2>
    </header>

    <p>The ability to separate the weather enclosure of the
      curtain wall from the structural function of the building
      frame leads to an important design decision—determining
      the position of the curtain wall in relation to the structural
      frame.</p>

    <ul>
      <p>A curtain wall assembly can be related to the structural
        frame of a building in three fundamental ways:</p>

      <li>
        <p>Behind the plane of the structural frame</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Within the plane of the structural frame</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>In front of the plane of the structural frame</p>
      </li>

    </ul>

    <header>
      <h2>Curtain Walls in Front of the Structural Frame</h2>
    </header>

    <ul>

      <p>The most common arrangement is to position the curtain
        wall assembly in front of the structural frame. Setting the
        plane of the curtain wall in this relation to the building
        structure allows the design of the exterior cladding to
        either emphasize the grid of the structural frame or offer a
        counterpoint to the pattern of columns and beams or slabs.</p>

      <li>
        <p>The curtain wall is able to form a continuous weather
          barrier without any structural penetrations.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Although the cumulative effects of thermal movement
          may be greater in the exterior curtain wall, the
          movement may be easier to accommodate because it is
          not constrained by the structural frame.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>The space within the depth of the
          column structure can be used for
          vertical services.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Structural steel members exposed
          on the interior of the building
          require fire-resistive assemblies
          or coatings.</p>
      </li>

        <h2>In-Plane Curtain Walls</h2>
      </header>

      <p>Positioning the curtain wall panels or assemblies within
        the plane of the structural frame will express the scale,
        proportions, and visual weight of the column-and-beam
        frame in the building facade.</p>

      <li>
        <p>The exposed columns and beams or slab edges may
          require weather-resistant cladding that incorporates a

        <h1>Structural Glass Facades</h1>
      </header>

      <p>Curtain walls and structural glass facades are closely
        related but differ in their manner of support. Typically,
        curtain walls span from floor to floor, attached to and
        supported by the primary structure of a building. Aluminum
        extrusions are generally used as part of a framework that
        secures some type of panel material—glazing, composite
        metal, stone, or terra cotta.</p>

      <p>Structural glass facades have emerged over the past
        several decades as a means of providing maximum
        transparency in buildings. Structural glass facades
        integrate structure and cladding and can be used in long-
        span applications. The structural systems used to support
        the glazing are exposed and distinct from the building's
        primary structure. Structural glass facades are generally
        categorized by the nature of the underlying support
        structure.</p>

            <h3>Strong-back system</h3>
          </header>
          <p>Strong-back system: The system consists of structural
            sections capable of accommodating the required
            span using vertical and/or horizontal components.
            Sometimes, horizontal beams, either straight or curved,
            are suspended from overhead cables and fixed to the
            anchoring building structure at their ends.</p>

          </header>
          <p>Glass fin systems: Glass fin-supported facades date
            back to the 1950s and represent a special case of glass
            technology that does not rely on a metal supporting
            structure except for hardware and splice plates. The
            glass fins are set perpendicular to the glass facade
            to provide lateral support and perform in a similar
            manner to strong-back structural members. A recent
            development uses multi-ply laminates of heat-treated
            glass beams as major structural elements.</p>

          <p>Planar truss system: Various configurations and types
            of planar trusses may be used to support the glass
            facades. The most commonly used truss is oriented
            vertically with its depth perpendicular to the plane of
            the glazing. Trusses are usually positioned at some
            regular interval, generally along a gridline of the building
            or a subdivision of the grid module. While trusses are
            most often vertical in elevation or linear in plan, they
            can also be sloped inward or outward and follow a
            curved geometry in plan. Trusses may be placed either
            on the exterior or interior side of the facade. The truss
            system will often incorporate bracing spreaders with
            diagonal tension counters for lateral stability.</p>

            <h3>Mast truss system</h3>
          </header>
          <p>Mast truss system: A mast truss uses tension elements
            to stabilize a central compression member (mast),
            usually consisting of a pipe or tube section. Cables are
            attached at the mast ends with spreader struts secured
            at intervals along the length of the mast. These spreader
            struts get longer toward the center of the mast, forming
            a cable arch between the mast ends. Cable arches
            provided on two sides or radially spaced on three or four
            sides about the mast can increase the buckling capacity
            of the mast. This system relies on pretensioning of the
            truss elements to provide stability.</p>

            <h3>Cabled truss systems</h3>
          </header>
          <p>Cabled truss systems: A cabled truss is similar to the
            mast truss but has no primary compression member.
            Spreader struts are the only compression elements in
            this type of truss. Without a main compression element,
            stability is achieved by tensioning the cables to the
            upper and lower boundary structure, unlike conventional
            planar trusses that achieve stability through their
            triangulated geometry.</p>

            <h3>Gridshells</h3>
          </header>
          <p>Gridshells: Gridshells, a structural type pioneered in
            the 1940s by Frei Otto, are form-active structures that
            derive their strength from double-curved (synclastic
            or anticlastic) surface geometry. The system uses a
            network of in-plane prestressed cables to provide
            stability and shear resistance to the thin shell grid.
            Vaulted, domed, and other double-curved configurations
            can be used in vertical and overhead applications as
            well as to form complete building enclosures.</p>

            <h3>Cable net systems</h3>
          </header>
          <p>Cable net systems: Cable nets represent one of the most
            recent developments in structural glass technology,
            minimizing the visible structural system and maximizing
            transparency. Horizontal and vertical cables yielding a
            net form are capable of spanning in two directions. The
            glass is supported by the net geometry of pretensioned
            cables. While the design of a cable net system can be
            flat, the nets are more often tensioned into double-
            curvature forms. Dual-function clamping components
            lock the cables together at their intersections as well as
            clamp the edges or corners of adjacent glass panes on
            the glazing grid.</p>

        <h1>Diagrids</h1>
      </header>

      <p>A diagrid refers to a structure of intersecting members that
        form a diagonal grid, connected at specially jointed nodes
        to create an integral network across a building surface
        capable of resisting lateral forces as well as gravity
        loads.</p>

      <p>This exoskeletal framework allows for the possible
        reduction of the number of internal supports, saving on
        space and building materials and providing for greater
        flexibility in interior layouts. Horizontal rings that tie all of
        the triangulated pieces together into a three-dimensional
        framework are necessary to provide buckling resistance to
        the exoskeletal grid.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>A diagrid pairs the structure of a continuous rigid
            shell, which resists loads in any direction, with
            the constructability afforded by the use of discrete
            elements.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Each diagonal can be viewed as providing a continuous
            load path to the ground. The number of possible load
            paths results in a high degree of redundancy.</p>

        <p>The One Shelley Street project uses a structural diagrid
          system to create a visually unique exterior. Because the
          diagrid is positioned on the outside of and very close to
          the glass facade, close monitoring, management, and
          coordination during fabrication and installation was
          required.</p>

        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>The concrete diagrid used in TOD's Omotesando
          Building is based on a pattern of overlapping tree
          silhouettes that mimic the branch structure of nearby elm
          trees. Similar to the growth pattern of trees, the diagrid
          members get thinner and more numerous with a higher
          ratio of openings as you move up higher in the building.
          The resulting structure supports floor slabs spanning 32
          to 50 feet (10 to 15 meters) without any internal columns.
          To minimize sway during an earthquake, the structure
          rests on a shock-absorbing foundation.</p>
