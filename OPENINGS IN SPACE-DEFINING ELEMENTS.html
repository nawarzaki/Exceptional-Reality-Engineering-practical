        <p>No spatial or visual continuity is possible with adjacent spaces
          without openings in the enclosing planes of a spatial field. Doors
          offer entry into a room and influence the patterns of movement
          and use within it. Windows allow light to penetrate the space
          and illuminate the surfaces of a room, offer views from the room
          to the exterior, establish visual relationships between the room
          and adjacent spaces, and provide for the natural ventilation of
          the space. While these openings provide continuity with adjacent
          spaces, they can, depending on their size, number, and location,
          also begin to weaken the enclosure of the space.</p>

        <p>The nature of the openings within
          the room's enclosure is a major factor in determining the quality
          of its space.</p>

        <p>An opening located wholly within a wall or ceiling
          plane often appears as a bright figure on a
          contrasting field or background. If centered within
          the plane, the opening will appear stable and
          visually organize the surface around it. Moving the
          opening off-center will create a degree of visual
          tension between the opening and the edges of the
          plane toward which it is moved.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/form space and order/OPENINGS IN SPACE/OPENINGS WITHIN PLANES 1.png" alt="OPENINGS IN SPACE"
            style="height: 24%; width: 48%;">
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>The shape of the opening, if similar to the shape
          of the plane in which it is located, will create a
          redundant compositional pattern. The shape or
          orientation of the opening may contrast with the
          enclosing plane to emphasize its individuality
          as a figure. The singularity of the opening may
          be visually reinforced with a heavy frame or
          articulated trimwork.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/form space and order/OPENINGS IN SPACE/OPENINGS WITHIN PLANES 2.png" alt="OPENINGS IN SPACE"
            style="height: 24%; width: 48%;">
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>Multiple openings may be clustered to form a
          unified composition within a plane, or be staggered
          or dispersed to create visual movement along the
          surface of the plane.</p>

        <figure>

            style="height: 24%; width: 48%;">
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>As an opening within a plane increases in size,
          it will at some point cease to be a figure within
          an enclosing field and become instead a positive
          element in itself, a transparent plane bounded by
          a heavy frame.</p>

        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>Openings within planes naturally appear
          brighter than their adjacent surfaces. If the
          contrast in brightness along the edges of the
          openings becomes excessive, the surfaces can be
          illuminated by a second light source from within
          the space, or a deep-set opening can be formed to
          create illuminated surfaces between the opening
          and the surrounding plane.</p>

        <h2>OPENINGS AT CORNERS</h2>
        <p>Openings that are located at corners give a
          space and the planes in which they are located a
          diagonal orientation. This directional effect may be
          desirable for compositional reasons, or the corner
          opening may be established to capture a desirable
          view or brighten a dark corner of a space.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/form space and order/OPENINGS AT CORNERS/OPENINGS AT CORNERS 1.png" alt="OPENINGS IN SPACE"
            style="height: 24%; width: 57%;">
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>A corner opening visually erodes the edges of the
          plane in which it is located and articulates the
          edge of the plane adjacent and perpendicular to
          it. The larger the opening, the weaker will be the
          definition of the corner. If the opening were to turn
          the corner, the angle of the space would be implied
          rather than real and the spatial field would extend
          beyond its enclosing planes.</p>

            style="height: 24%; width: 57%;">
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>If openings are introduced between the enclosing
          planes at all four corners of a space, the individual
          identity of the planes will be reinforced and
          diagonal or pinwheel patterns of space, use, and
          movement will be encouraged.</p>

        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>The light that enters a space through a corner
          opening washes the surface of the plane adjacent
          and perpendicular to the opening. This illuminated
          surface itself becomes a source of light and
          enhances the brightness of the space. The level of
          illumination can be enhanced further by turning
          the corner with the opening or adding a skylight
          above the opening.</p>

        <p>A vertical opening that extends from the floor to
          the ceiling plane of a space visually separates and
          articulates the edges of the adjacent wall planes.</p>

        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>If located at a corner, the vertical opening will erode
          the definition of the space and allow it to extend
          beyond the corner to the adjacent space. It will also
          allow incoming light to wash the surface of the wall
          plane perpendicular to it and articulate the primacy of
          that plane in the space. If allowed to turn the corner,
          the vertical opening will further erode the definition of
          the space, allow it to interlock with adjacent spaces,
          and emphasize the individuality of the enclosing
          planes.</p>

        <p>A horizontal opening that extends across a wall
          plane will separate it into a number of horizontal
          layers. If the opening is not very deep, it will not erode
          the integrity of the wall plane. If, however, its depth
          increases to the point where it is greater than the
          bands above and below it, then the opening will become
          a positive element bounded at its top and bottom by
          heavy frames.</p>

        <p>Turning a corner with a horizontal opening reinforces
          the horizontal layering of a space and broadens the
          panoramic view from within the space. If the opening
          continues around the space, it will visually lift the
          ceiling plane from the wall planes, isolate it, and give it
          a feeling of lightness.</p>

        <p>Locating a linear skylight along the edge where a wall
          and ceiling plane meet allows incoming light to wash
          the surface of the wall, illuminate it, and enhance the
          brightness of the space. The form of the skylight can
          be manipulated to capture direct sunlight, indirect
          daylight, or a combination of both.</p>

          shading devices may be necessary to reduce glare
          and excessive heat gain within the space.</p>

        <p>While a window-wall weakens the vertical boundaries

        <p>The qualities of an
          architectural space, however, are much richer than
          what the diagrams are able to portray. The spatial
          qualities of form, proportion, scale, texture, light,
          and sound ultimately depend on the properties of the
          enclosure of a space. Our perception of these qualities
          is often a response to the combined effects of the
          properties encountered and is conditioned by culture,
          prior experiences, and personal interest or inclination.</p>

          <h3>DEGREE OF ENCLOSURE</h3>
        </header>

        <p>The degree of enclosure of a space, as determined by the configuration of its defining
          elements and the pattern of its openings, has a significant impact on our perception of
          its form and orientation. From within a space, we see only the surface of a wall. It is this
          thin layer of material that forms the vertical boundary of the space. The actual thickness
          of a wall plane can be revealed only along the edges of door and window openings.</p>


        <p>Openings lying wholly within the enclosing planes of a space do not weaken the edge
          definition nor the sense of closure of the space. The form of the space remains intact
          and perceptible.</p>

        <figure>
          <img

            alt="QUALITIES OF ARCHITECTURAL SPACE" style="height: 24%; width: 48%;">
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>Openings located along the edges of the enclosing planes of a space visually weaken the
          corner boundaries of the volume. While these openings erode the overall form of a space,
          they also promote its visual continuity and interaction with adjacent spaces.</p>

            alt="QUALITIES OF ARCHITECTURAL SPACE" style="height: 24%; width: 48%;">
        </figure> <br><br>


        <p>Openings between the enclosing planes of a space visually isolate the planes and
          articulate their individuality. As these openings increase in number and size, the space
          loses its sense of enclosure, becomes more diffuse, and begins to merge with adjacent
          spaces. The visual emphasis is on the enclosing planes rather than the volume of space
          defined by the planes.</p>
