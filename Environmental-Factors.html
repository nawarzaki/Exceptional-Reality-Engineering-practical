          <h2>Environmental Factors</h2>
        </header>

        <div id="EnvironmentalFactors">

          <ul>

            <li>
              <h4>Climate and Weather</h4>
              <p>Weather and climate should be keys to determining the type of structure to be built.
                Building materials should be suitable to the climate so that they will not be subject
                to excessive deterioration.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Physical Location.</h4>
              <p> Physical location involves
                factors such as site, view, prevailing winds,
                solar exposure, noise, and environmental hazards.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Site</h4>
              <p>The site of a building should influence its design.
                The building should be compatible with its neighbors,
                though the style need not be the same, merely harmonious.</p>

              <p>In general, a client engages a designer once a site or space is in hand. It is then the designer's
                task to analyze the space to ensure that it will meet the client's needs. Sometimes, a client may
                not have a single space in mind, but rather a few options that the designer will test to ascertain
                which one best suits the client's needs. </p>

              <p>Both of these scenarios suggest that the client is working toward a particular program; however,
                sometimes the physical space generates the program.
                In this case, the designer's task is to decide the best layout for the space and design a program
                within those constraints.
              </p>

                <img src="images/site.png" alt="outdoor living space" style="width:500px;height:600px;">
                <figcaption>outdoor living Space</figcaption>
              </figure>
            </li>

            <li>

              <h4>View</h4>
              <p>Beautiful daytime or nighttime views are a valuable
                asset to an interior and should be featured in the design of the building.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Prevailing Winds</h4>
              <p>Prevailing winds can be a positive or negative feature of a location.
                They can provide pleasant breezes or disturbing winds. When breezes prevail,
                buildings should be oriented to use the wind for natural cooling.
                When winds are gusty or icy cold,
                the building and its landscaping should provide shelter and protection.
                Berms (small constructed hills) or trees planted in a windbreak can help
                minimize the effect of cold winter winds.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Solar Exposure</h4>
              <p>Like the wind, the sun can be both a positive and a negative factor.
                In the winter, the sun streaming through south windows may be warm and comforting,
                but without adequate protection from the sun, an interior may become difficult to cool,
                and ultraviolet rays and heat can damage furnishings as well as produce
                disturbing glare.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Noise</h4>
              <p>Some types of noise are enjoyable</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Environmental Hazards</h4>
              <p>When planning, it is important to be aware of hazardous conditions,
                some serious enough to warrant selection of a new site.
                Fault lines, slide areas, eroding waterfronts,
                areas subject to flooding or forest fi res, high-power lines, and railroad.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Mechanical Considerations</h4>
              <p>Mechanical considerations include heating, ventilation, air-conditioning (HVAC),
                plumbing, and lighting.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Privacy and Interaction. </h4>
              <p>Some people are rather private by nature, whereas others are more gregarious.
                Regard-less of our basic social nature, we all have times when we need to be
                alone and times when we need to interact with others. Spaces such as living rooms,
                family rooms, game rooms, dining rooms, and even kitchens should be planned for
                interaction. In many homes the kitchen is the heart. Even when
                Homes are provided with areas for individual study, many times family members will
                end up studying around the kitchen table. When guests arrive for parties, they
                frequently gravitate to the kitchen. It is this tendency that has led to the
                popularity of great rooms, which are large kitchen/dining/family room spaces where
                most of the day-to-day living is centered. It is equally important to plan spaces
                where members of the household can be alone. Libraries, studies, work-rooms,
                or bedrooms are logical places for privacy.

                <figcaption>Privacy and Interaction. </figcaption>
              </figure>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Cultural Relationships</h4>
              <p>When an interior will be used by people with ties to a foreign culture,
                it can benefit from incorporating cultural elements,
                from structural features and choice of materials to displays of artwork or crafts.
                In this way the interior becomes an extension of personal history and experience.</p>

              </figure>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Security and Safety. </h4>
              <p>The physical safety of the occupants and possessions can affect the psychological
                well-being of a home The need for protection is one of the most basic reasons for
                seeking the shelter of a home.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Economic Factors</h4>
              <p>Economic factors are some of the most important considerations because
                they have such an impact on the extent of the design. Without proper funding,
                a design can remain forever on paper.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Design Preferences</h4>
              <p>As data are gathered, the client`s or user`s design preferences may be sought.
                They include preferences of theme, color,
                and even historic-period or contemporary styles</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Codes</h4>
              <p>Codes and restrictions are laws established by federal, state,
                and local governments and their agencies for the health, safety,
                and welfare of the user.</p>
