      </header>

      <h3>Foundation Grids</h3>

      <p>The primary function of a foundation system is to support
        and anchor the superstructure above and transmit its loads
        safely into the earth. Because the foundation serves as
        a critical link in the distribution and resolution of building
        loads, its pattern of supports must be designed to both
        accommodate the form and layout of the superstructure
        above and respond to the varying conditions of soil, rock,
        and water below.</p>

      <p>The bearing capacity of the supporting soil will impact
        the choice of a foundation type for a building. Shallow
        or spread foundations are employed when stable soil of
        adequate bearing capacity occurs relatively near to the
        ground surface. Footings are proportioned to distribute
        their load over a wide enough area that the allowable
        bearing capacity of the soil is not exceeded. This should
        ensure that whatever settlement does occur is minimal or
        is uniformly distributed under all portions of the structure.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/STRUCTURAL PATTERNS/Shallow or spread foundations.jpg"
          alt="STRUCTURAL PATTERNS" style="height: 24%; width: 48%;">
        <figcaption>
          <p><b>The magnitude, pattern, and
              distribution of building loads on
              a foundation is directly related to
              the size and arrangement of the
              structural bays.</b></p>
          <p><b>Smaller structural bays distribute
              their loads over a greater
              number of smaller footings. </b></p>
          <p><b>Conversely, larger structural bays
              result in fewer but individually
              larger footings and foundations.</b></p>
        </figcaption>
      </figure> <br><br>


      <p>When the bearing capacity of the soil on a site varies,
        spread foundations may be joined by a structural plinth or
        mat foundationâ€”essentially, a thick, heavily reinforced
        concrete slab. Mat foundations distribute concentrated
        loads to areas of higher-capacity soil to avoid the
        differential settlement that would occur between individual
        spread footings.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/STRUCTURAL PATTERNS/plinth or mat foundation.png"
          alt="STRUCTURAL PATTERNS" style="height: 24%; width: 48%;">
        <figcaption>
          <p><b>Mat foundation</b></p>
        </figcaption>
      </figure> <br><br>


      <p>When building loads exceed the bearing capacity of the
        supporting soil, pile or caisson foundations must be used.
        Pile foundations consist of steel, concrete, or timber piles
        that are driven into the ground until they reach a more
        suitable bearing stratum of dense soil or rock or until the
        friction of the soil on the piles is sufficient to support the
        design loads. Individual piles are typically joined with a
        cast-in-place concrete cap that in turn supports a building
        column.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/STRUCTURAL PATTERNS/pile or caisson foundations.png"
          alt="STRUCTURAL PATTERNS" style="height: 24%; width: 48%;">
      </figure> <br><br>


      <p>Caissons are cast-in-place concrete shafts that are created
        by drilling the soil to the required depth, placing reinforcing
        steel, and casting the concrete. Caissons are generally
        larger in diameter than piling and are particularly suited to
        slopes where lateral displacement is a major concern.</p>

      <header>
        <h2>Building on Slopes</h2>
      </header>

      <p>Pile foundations can be used on irregular or sloping
        topography, particularly where the surface soil on the slope
        may be unstable and the pilings can extend down to bear
        on or in more stable stratum of soil or rock. In such cases,
        it may not be necessary to retain soil, and the location of
        the piles can align with the desired column locations in the
        building.</p>

      <p>When it is desirable or necessary to excavate into a slope,
        retaining walls are often employed to contain the mass
        of earth above the grade change. The retained soil is
        considered to act as a fluid that exerts lateral pressure on
        the face of the retaining wall, tending to cause the wall
        to slide laterally or to overturn. The overturning moment
        created by the lateral soil pressure and the opposing
        resistance of the wall's foundation is critically dependent
        on the height of the wall. The moment increases with the
        square of the height of the earth that is retained. As a
        retaining wall becomes taller, it may be necessary to install
        tiebacks to piling or to build in counterforts â€”cross walls
        that stiffen the wall slab and add weight to its footing.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/STRUCTURAL PATTERNS/series of retaining walls.jpg"
          alt="STRUCTURAL PATTERNS" style="height: 24%; width: 39%;">
        <figcaption>
          <p><b>A series of retaining walls parallel to the slope can provide
              continuous support for bearing walls in the superstructure
              of the building. It is not advisable to add the weight of the
              building to the soil behind the retaining wall. The location
              of the retaining walls should therefore coincide with lines
              of support in the building above.</b></p>
        </figcaption>
      </figure> <br><br>

      <ul>
        <p>A retaining wall may fail by overturning, horizontal sliding,
          or excessive settling.</p>

        <li>
          <p>Thrust tends to overturn a retaining wall about the
            toe of the base. To prevent a retaining wall from
            overturning, the resisting moment of the composite
            weight of the wall and any soil bearing on the heel of
            the base must counter the overturning moment created
            by the soil pressure.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>To prevent a retaining wall from sliding, the composite
            weight of the wall times the coefficient of friction for
            the soil supporting the wall must counter the lateral
            thrust on the wall. The passive pressure of the soil
            abutting the lower level of the wall aids in resisting the
            lateral thrust.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>To prevent a retaining wall from settling, the vertical
            force must not exceed the bearing capacity of the soil.</p>
        </li>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/STRUCTURAL PATTERNS/retaining wall.jpg" alt="STRUCTURAL PATTERNS"
            style="height: 24%; width: 48%;">
        </figure> <br><br>
      </ul>

      <p>For small projects, particularly when the design does not
        require excavation into a sloping site, grade beams may be
        used to tie the foundation into a single, rigid unit that is in
        turn anchored to piling, usually at the upper portion of the
        site. This has been successful where minimum disruption
        of the site is desirable and on sites that are primarily
        accessible from the high side.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/STRUCTURAL PATTERNS/grade beams.jpg" alt="STRUCTURAL PATTERNS"
          style="height: 24%; width: 48%;">
      </figure> <br><br>

      <p>When the design does not require excavation into a
        sloping site, the foundation walls may run perpendicular
        to the slope and be stepped to follow the topography.
        Because stepped foundation walls do not retain earth,
        they will typically not require the reinforcement and large
        footings of a retaining wall.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Footings must be stepped when necessary to keep them
            in the ground when site slopes exceed 10%.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Footing thickness should be maintained in its vertical
            portion.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Footings are to be placed on undisturbed soil or on
            properly compacted fill.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Footings are to be at least 12 inches (305) below grade,
            except in conditions where frost occurs, in which case
            the footings must extend below the frost line of the site.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Footing tops are to be level, whereas the bottom of
            footings may have a slope of up to 10%.</p>
        </li>
