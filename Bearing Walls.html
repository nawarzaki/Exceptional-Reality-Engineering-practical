        <h1>Bearing Walls</h1>
      </header>

      <p>A bearing wall is any wall construction capable of
        supporting an imposed load, as from a floor or roof of a
        building, and transmitting the compressive forces through
        the plane of the wall down to the foundation. Bearing
        wall systems can be constructed of masonry, cast-in-place
        concrete, site-cast tilt-up concrete, or wood or metal studs.</p>

      <p>Bearing walls should be continuous from floor to floor
        and be aligned vertically from the roof to the foundation.
        Because of this continuity, bearing walls can act as shear
        walls and provide lateral resistance against earthquake
        or wind forces acting parallel to the plane of the walls.
        However, due to their relative thinness, bearing walls are
        unable to provide significant shear resistance to lateral
        forces acting perpendicular to their plane.</p>

      <p>In addition to resisting the crushing or buckling from gravity
        loads, exterior bearing walls are subject to bending from
        horizontal wind loads. These forces are transferred to
        horizontal roof and floor planes and then to lateral force-
        resisting elements acting perpendicular to the bearing
        walls.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Concrete slabs and roof or floor joists impose a
            uniformly distributed load along the top of a bearing
            wall. If there are no openings to disrupt the load path
            from the top of the wall, a uniform load will result on
            the top of the footing.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Vertical loads must be redirected to either side of
            openings through the use of header beams in light-
            frame construction; arches or lintels in masonry
            construction; or additional reinforcing steel in concrete
            construction.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Concentrated loads develop at the top of a wall when
            the columns or beams they support are spaced at
            wide intervals. Depending on the wall material, the
            concentrated load is distributed along an angle of 45ยบ
            to 60ยบ as it moves down the wall. The resulting footing
            load will be nonuniform, with the largest forces directly
            under the applied load.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Building codes specify the required fire-resistance of
            exterior walls based on location, type of construction,
            and occupancy. Often walls meeting these requirements
            are also appropriate as bearing walls.</p>

          <h2>Concrete Walls</h2>
        </header>

        <p>Concrete walls may be precast, either on-site or off-site;
          more often, they are cast in place. The advantage of
          precast walls is in the high quality of concrete finishes that
          can be achieved and the fact that they can be prestressed.
          Typically, precast panels are used when the concrete wall
          will provide the finish wall surfaces. Precast wall panels
          are particularly appropriate for low-rise buildings that are
          not subject to high lateral loads.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Site-cast concrete walls may be used as the primary
              vertical loadbearing elements of a structure or in
              conjunction with steel or concrete frames.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The high fire resistance of concrete makes it an ideal
              material for enclosing building cores and shafts, and for
              serving as shear walls.</p>
          </li>

            <p> Door and window openings require reinforcement along
              their edges and corners.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Concrete walls may be cast integrally with concrete
              floor systems and serve effectively as shear walls. </p>

            <p>Anchor reinforced concrete walls to floor slabs,

              two layers placed parallel with the faces of the wall.</p>

          <li>
            <p>It is generally preferable to vary the amount and
              placement of steel reinforcement required for special
              load conditions than it is to vary the wall thickness.</p>

          <li>
            <p>1 1/2" (38) minimum cover when concrete is exposed to
              earth or weather; 2" (51) minimum for No. 6 bars and
              larger.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Concrete walls usually rest on a continuous strip
              footing.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Wall is tied to its footing with dowels bent in alternate

              and permanently exposed to the earth.</p>

        </ul>
        <br><br>

        <p>With the possible exception of multistory buildings, the
          bearing capacity of reinforced concrete walls typically will
          not be the critical factor in determining the thickness of the
          wall. Concrete walls must be supported laterally at regular
          intervals, both vertically and along their length. Intersecting
          floors or roofs stabilize the height of concrete walls while
          perpendicular walls or pilasters stabilize their length.</p>

          <h2>Masonry Walls</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Masonry construction refers to building with units of
          various natural or manufactured products, such as stone,
          brick, or concrete block, usually with the use of mortar
          as a bonding agent to form walls that are durable,
          fire-resistant, and structurally efficient in compression.
          The most common structural masonry units are precast
          concrete masonry units (CMU) or concrete block. Because
          concrete block is more economical and easily reinforced, it
          has generally replaced fired clay brick and tile for bearing
          walls. Brick and clay tile are used primarily for their
          appearance as a finished surface, typically as a veneer on
          light frame or concrete block bearing walls.</p>

        <p>Masonry bearing walls may be constructed as solid
          walls, cavity walls, or veneered walls. While they can be
          constructed without reinforcing, masonry bearing walls
          should be reinforced in seismic zones by embedding steel
          reinforcing bars placed in thickened joints or cavities with
          a fluid grout mix of portland cement, aggregate, and water
          for greater strength in carrying vertical loads and increased
          resistance to buckling and lateral forces. It is essential that
          a strong bond develop between the reinforcing steel, grout,
          and masonry units.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Standard CMU blocks have two or three cores and
              nominal dimensions of 8" x 8" x 16" (7 5/8" x 7 5/8" x
              15 5/8" actual; 205 x 205 x 405). </p>

            <p>Mortar is a plastic mixture of cement or lime, or a
              combination of both, with sand and water, used as a
              bonding agent in masonry construction. Mortar joints
              vary in thickness from 1/4" to 1/2" (6 to 13) but are
              typically 3/8" (10) thick.</p>

              cavities filled entirely with grout as the work progresses.
              The grout used to consolidate the adjoining materials
              into a solid mass is a fluid Portland cement mortar that
              will flow easily without segregation of the ingredients.</p>

          <h1>Stud-Framed Walls </h1>
        </header>

        <p>Light frame walls are constructed of light-gauge metal
          or wood studs that are typically spaced 12", 16", or 24"
          (305, 405, or 610) on center, depending on the desired wall
          height and the size and spanning capability of common
          sheathing and surfacing materials. </p>

        <p>Light frame construction
          is typically used for bearing walls in low-rise structures
          that take advantage of the lightweight components and
          ease of assembly. The system is particularly well suited for
          buildings that are irregular in form or layout.</p>

        <p>Light-gauge metal studs are manufactured by cold-
          forming sheet or strip steel. The cold-formed metal studs
          can be easily cut and assembled with simple tools into
          a wall structure that is lightweight, noncombustible,
          and dampproof. </p>

        <p>Metal stud walls may be used as
          nonloadbearing partitions or as bearing walls supporting
          light-gauge steel joists. Unlike wood light framing, metal
          light framing can be used for fabricating partitions in
          noncombustible construction. However, the fire-resistance
          rating of both wood and metal light frame wall assemblies
          is based on the fire resistance of the surfacing materials.</p>

        <p>Both metal and wood stud walls can be idealized as
          monolithic walls when loaded uniformly from above. The
          studs carry the vertical and horizontal bending loads while
          the sheathing stiffens the plane of the wall and distributes
          both horizontal and vertical loads between individual
          studs. Any opening in the wall framing requires the use of
          header beams that redirect the loads to either side of the
          openings. Concentrated loads from the header reactions
          must be supported by a build-up of studs resembling a
          column.</p>

          <h1>Platform Framing</h1>
        </header>

        <p>Platform framing is a light wood frame having studs only
          one story high, regardless of the stories built, with each
          story resting on the top plates of the story below or on the
          sill plates of the foundation wall.</p>

        <ul>
          <h3>Metal Studs</h3>

          <li>
            <p>Light-gauge metal studs are 1" to 1 5/8" (25 to 41) thick
              and 2 1/2" to 8" (64 to 205) wide.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The metal studs are usually prepunched to allow piping,
              wiring, and bracing to pass through.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Connections are made with self-drilling, self-tapping
              screws inserted with an electric or pneumatic tool, or
              with pneumatically driven pins.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Concentrated loads must be supported by additional
              framing within the wall plane.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Floor joists rest on the top plate of the stud wall below.</p>
