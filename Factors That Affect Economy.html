          <h2>Factors That Affect Economy</h2>
        </header>

        <ul>
          <header>
            <h4>Planning Home Space</h4>
          </header>

          <li>
            <p>Interest rates also affect the cost of the payments and, hence, whether or not the home or building
              can
              be afforded.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Environmentally sound building and furnishing materials, such as ICFs, will stay
              functional for many years, thus avoiding replacement and high energy consumption. Likewise, modest
              square
              footage and standard-sized ceilings cost less to build, finish, heat, and cool. This is considered
              long-term economy.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              The cubic footage affects the cost. Areas with very high ceilings will be more costly to construct
              because
              of the additional building materials required.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Simple building shapes contribute to economy. A home with many jogs, angles, gables (roof points),
              and
              dormers (windows in the roof) will make the cost per square foot rise, increasing the cost of the
              interior
              space. The closer the home is to a simple box, the more economical it will be to build.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Long-range space planning can be a boon to saving money. When a space is to be finished or remodeled
              at a
              later date, structural planning or framing can accommodate the future changes. For example, if a room
              will
              one day adjoin another via French doors, the frame-work for that doorway can be put in place as the
              home
              is built, thus avoiding major remodeling. The exterior style and shape should always be taken into
              consideration when planning additions so that the home will look as though the addition belonged there
              all
              along, not as if it were an awkward afterthought. Careful space planning will reduce the frustrations
              and
              increase the rewards of an eventual remodel.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Economy can be increased by planning to avoid unusable wasted space or poor traffic patterns.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The proper scale and proportion of rooms in relation to the interior space should be considered. This
              means judging the intended function of the area and planning square and cubic footage to meet the
              demands
              for that space. </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Economy is evident when the size of rooms allows the user to function without crowding or
              frustration. A
              space that is too small can necessitate costly expansion by remodeling.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              It can be economical to double up purposes in an area, called a multiuse area, and to make space
              appear
              larger than it is.
            </p>
        </ul>

            <h3>Features and Beneﬁts</h3>
          </header>
          <p>The motivator for building or remodeling is rooted in function; users have functional needs and wants
            that
            are not being fulfilled by the features of their existing home. Knowing that the process is going to be
            difficult, lengthy, and costly, people are willing to endure these in-conveniences because they envision
            a
            home with design solutions that will provide a better environment for rest, recreation, work, or other
            activities.</p>

          <p>One of the first things an individual or family should do when considering building or remodeling is to
            make a wish list, an extensive list of the features the users want and the reasons why they
            want them. It is important to take a hard, realistic look at the “why” during this brainstorming stage.
            As
            the best designs are based on wants justified by needs, the “why” will deter-mine how seriously a given
            feature is needed. </p>

          <p>An attractive or fashionable feature that will be only rarely used by anyone in the household is
            probably
            not a good in-vestment. In fact, there may be a variety of design features that will convey the same
            benefit, so after giving careful consideration to function, the user may end up choosing an entirely
            different feature from the one originally named. The more benefits a feature can provide, the more
            likely it
            is to be a viable option.</p>
