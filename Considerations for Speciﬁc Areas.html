            <h2>proportions of a room</h2>
          </header>

          <ul>
            <p>In the disciplines of art and design, proportion is concerned with one of the fundamental
              characteristics
              of shape:
            </p>

            <li>
              <p>the aspect ratio of width to length. Significantly, the
                qualification of the proportion of a shape does not concern itself with dimensions.
              </p>
              <p>When designers speak of the proportions of a shape, they are usually discussing the
                relative width and length of a rectangle, but they can also address the proportion
                of an oval, or even complex and irregular forms such as the proportions of a kidney-shaped swimming
                pool.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Most typically, proportions are considered when making design decisions about a series of related
                elements. For example, the designer should
                consider the proportion of the wall space between windows as well as the proportion
                of the windows themselves when designing an interior elevation.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The relative proportion of the shape of the wall and the shape of the window can be construed as a
                more complex proportional relationship.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Proportion is considered in two dimensions
                in drawing and painting and when composing a plan or an elevation.
              </p>
            </li>

          <ul>
            <p>For interior design, the proportion of a space or an object is qualified by the relative length of
              three variables:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>width</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>length </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>and height</p>
              </li>

              <p>The character and use of a room is strongly influenced by the proportion of the space.
              </p>
            </ul>

            <li>
              <p>A room that is relatively long, narrow, and tall is much
                different in character than a room that is square in plan with a low ceiling.
              </p>
            </li>

              <p>The relative proportion of a room qualifies whether a space is primarily meant as
                a path or a place.

            <li>
              <p>Square rooms
                are the most geometrically stable, but are difficult to furnish and thus used for ceremonial
                functions when large or as threshold spaces when small.

            <li>
              <p>Rectangular spaces with proportions
                of less than 1:2 are the most common shape of place-rooms since they can accommodate a
                variety of furniture arrangements and can be easily aggregated along circulation armatures.
                Long, narrow rooms are typically circulation spaces, whether functional corridors or spaces for
                processional rituals and ceremonies.

            <li>
              <p>Rooms can be arranged as a proportional related sequence of spaces. The richest sequences
                of rooms typically contrast rooms of different but related proportions to create visual variety
                and to provoke a sense of discovery. Strategies that consider contrasting proportions of
                rooms also seek contrasting qualities of light to enliven the itinerary.

              <h4>An Intuition for Proportion </h4>
              <p>Talented designers have an innate sense of proportion. In fact, this is one of the essential
                skills that every artist and designer needs to develop.
              </p>
              <p>When proportions are considered intuitively, expressions such as "relative weight," "balance," and
                "designing the space in-between"
                may capture the synthesis of visual choices during design.
              </p>
              <p>To speak of a "beautifully proportioned facade" suggests a
                recognition of an overall balance among the proportions of the windows, the spaces between
                the windows, and the proportion of the wall itself. When proportions are designed and appreciated
                intuitively, the visual tastes of the creator and observer play an important role.
              </p>
              <p>Some
                designers prefer dynamic compositions with strongly contrasting proportions, while others
                may seek stasis and balance. The history of visual styles is partly the history of the changing
                tastes for proportional and compositional strategies.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Whole-Number Proportions</h4>
              <p>The most common of
                these systems relate the length, width, and height of a room in simple whole numbers. For
                example, a rectangular room can be qualified as a room that is twice as long as wide with a
                ceiling as tall as its width. Such a room can be defined as a simple whole-number proportion:
                1:2:1
              </p>
              <p>Andrea Palladio famously used a whole-number proportioning system to design and organize
                the rooms for his palace and villa commissions in the sixteenth century. The plans of the
                rooms in Palladio's buildings are typically organized in whole-number ratios of 1:1 (the square)
                or rectangles of 1 :2,2:3, and 3:5. Significantly, he avoided other ratios such as 3:4 or 4:5,
                because
                the resulting shapes sit uncomfortably between the stable square and the directionality of the
                rectangle.

            <h3>The Golden Rectangle</h3>
          </header>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>golden rectangle (also known as the golden section, the golden mean, and the magic
                rectangle). To construct a golden rectangle, a square must first be subdivided into two rectangles,
                each
                with 1:2 proportions. If the hypotenuse of one of the rectangles is drawn and then
                rotated to follow the radius of a circle with its center at the pivot point, a golden rectangle will
                result. The golden rectangle has a proportion of 1:1.618. </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>This rectangle is golden and magical not just because of how it is generated, but also because
                    of its inherent geometric properties: It is the only rectangle that comprises a square and
                    another similar (equally proportioned) rectangle. The logic of this characteristic means that a
                    golden rectangle can be endlessly subdivided, with each smaller golden rectangle begetting
                    its own square and smaller golden rectangle. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>The golden rectangle can be a helpful proportion in interior design, best used for relating
                    asymmetrical subdivisions of wall surfaces and/or rooms. Whenever the golden rectangle is
                    applied to
                    an overall room proportion, the component square of the rectangle should also be present,
                    whether as
                    the ceiling height or as some stable subset of the larger directional space. </p>

            <li>
              <p>the radical two rectangle (also known
                as the root two rectangle). Its geometric construction is similar to the golden rectangle. In
                this case, however, the full hypotenuse of the generating square is drawn and rotated. The
                resulting proportion is thus less attenuated than that of the golden rectangle. The ratio of the
                radical two rectangle is 1:1.414.</p>

                  <p>In the 1940s, the French architect Le
                    Corbusier used the generating logics of
                    both the golden rectangle and the radical
                    two rectangles to generate a complex
                    proportioning and dimensioning system
                    called the Modular. </p>

            spaces, so that a project reflects a single design approach. Acknowledging the necessary collaboration
            between architects and interior designers, it is important to
            understand the two primary vehicles for organizing the relationship between rooms:
            the plan and the cross section. </p>

          <ul>
            <h3>Through-Room and Independent Circulation</h3>
            <li>
              <p>Interior design typically begins with the plan. Fundamental to the logic of the plan is the
                distinction between rooms that can serve as both places and as routes for through-
                circulation-such as the living room, dining room, and kitchen-and rooms that, because
                of issues of privacy, require a separate circulation space or network of spaces to access
                them-such as bedrooms and bathrooms.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Servant Spaces</h4>
              <p>A third type of space comprises closets, storage rooms, pantries, fireplaces, and powder
                rooms. Spaces of this category should be consolidated into systemic "thick-wall" zones to
                create acoustical privacy between larger rooms and to generate a logic for the plumbing,
                ventilation,
                and mechanical systems and overall structure of the house. When composing a plan,
                it is useful to consider these consolidated smaller spaces as solid masses, in opposition to
                the open spaces of major rooms.

            <h3>Relationships between Rooms </h3>
          </header>

          <p>Networks of rooms can be conceived by aggregating rooms, with the gap between each
            room functioning as both a thick-wall poche zone and a threshold space. Rooms can also be
            created by subdividing a space with thick-wall zones or chunks of poche, as the Farnsworth
            House illustrates below.
          </p>

            <figcaption>The plan of the Farnsworth House
              is a modern example of poche; the
              kitchen, bathroom, and storage
              areas are collected into one single
              volume in the open plan. </figcaption>

          <ul>
            <h4>COMPOSING A HOUSE IN SECTION</h4>
            <li>
              <p>If a house is conceived as a series of independent floor levels, then every room on each floor
                will share the same ceiling height. Ideally, however, a house should have rooms whose ceiling
                heights
                differ in proportion to the overall size of each space. The height of the living room
                should be greater than that of the powder room or a coat closet, for example. Opportunities for
                such a house of interlocking rooms with different ceiling heights are best explored in section. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The simplest way to organize a mixture of ceiling heights is to make one or several rooms
                double-height spaces, with the potential that rooms on the second level can look onto these
                taller spaces.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Another strategy for varying spatial heights in a house is to connect one-and-a-half-story
                rooms to adjacent one-story rooms via short stairs. Separating sections of the house by
                partial-level
                stairs rather than the full-floor stairs of conventional house designs offers numerous
                psychological and functional advantages. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>As a variation on this strategy, in the 1920s Adolf Loos designed a series of houses that
                organize the rooms of the main living level with a common ceiling plane, but allow the floor
                levels to shift, creating rooms with a mix of ceiling heights. As a result, the interiors of Loos's
                houses resemble a terraced landscape. In houses with these complex sectional relationships,
                the interconnecting stair needs to be carefully designed to take full advantage of views into
                taller spaces and beyond to the exterior. </p>

            <h3>The Entry or Foyer </h3>

          <p>An entryway allows for traffic to flow to all areas of the house without having to cross a main or

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>There should be ample room to accommodate the number of people who would occupy the space at any
                given
                time. If entertaining is customary, an entry or foyer larger than 3.3 square metre (approximately
                1.5
                metre * 2.2 metre) should be considered.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Two-story open entryways, or atria, are dramatic and impressive. They allow for grand chandeliers
                and
                sweeping staircases. However, they typically have windows above the doorway that are
                ill-proportioned

          Living rooms, dining rooms, and showcase dens or libraries seen from the entry or foyer are considered

          living spaces.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Formal living spaces are typically separated from the kitchen and other work spaces. This allows
                them
                to stay tidier, and precious furnishings placed in them can be protected.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Formal spaces are ideal for reclusiveness and study, music listening or rehearsal, formal
                gatherings
                and dinners. They provide a restrained, subdued atmosphere and encourage seemly behavior.</p>

              <p>Formal living spaces may be occupied so infrequently that they are economically difficult to

            <h3>Home Ofﬁce Planning</h3>
          </header>
          <p>Office space in the home has become a necessity for a great many individuals and families as
            telecommuting,
            home-based businesses, and computer management of personal finances continue to rise in popularity.</p>

          <p>As with other space planning, it is best to consider function be-fore making other decisions about the
            home
            office.</p>

          <p>Here are some of the possible functions the office may fulfill:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>“Home base,” where a worker who has a conventional office can accomplish work during non-office
                hours
                or sit while resolving “on-call” emergencies.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Work area for an employee who telecommutes full- or part-time.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Accommodation for a home-based business, which may or may not call for additional employees or
                customers to spend periods of time in the house.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Household financial center, where personal bills are paid and tax returns prepared.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Internet-access and study area for adults and/or children On the basis of the functions the office
                needs to fulfill, consider the issues below. Some users may decide that their home needs more than
                one
                office space to meet all their needs.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Will more than one user utilize the office space at the same time or different times?</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Does quiet and privacy play a role in the work to be done? If so, then having a separate room that
                is
                not near the noise or activity center is wise planning. <br>
                Where work is ongoing or creates a necessary mess, it is wise to plan for a room with a door that
                can
                close and even lock.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Plan for shelves, filing cabinets, and closets or furniture that can hold items that need to be
                stored. These might include boxes of computer paper, extra office supplies, noncurrent fi les, and
                reports or client or school information that should be saved.</p>

          </header>
          <p>Where to Locate the Home Ofﬁce:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                On the main floor, just off the entry. This is a good location if the office will never be untidy
                and
                if clients are expected to come to the front door.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>At a separate entrance, if the office accommodates many clients or delivery personnel or an
                employee or
                two.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Near the kitchen in a location that is easily seen and accessible. Monitoring the use of the
                Internet
                has become a priority for many parents in order to protect their family members from exposure to
                influences conflicting with family standards. This area might be a den, family or great room, or
                even a
                hallway within sight of major traffic patterns.</p>
              <p> It is best kept away from the actual food preparation/cooking area but easily seen from there.
                Some
                families need more than one computer, and when monitoring is a priority, space planning for carrels
                or
                long electrically wired tables takes special thought.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>At a desk within the kitchen. This is convenient for the daily routine, but the desk should be kept
                outside the major work triangle(s) of the kitchen. The advantage is that cooking, family
                interaction,
                and supervising of others' activities can take place simultaneously. The disadvantage is that it is
                difficult or impossible to concentrate where there is noise.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>In a bedroom with a door that can close. This may be on the main floor, upstairs, or even in a
                basement. The advantage is quiet seclusion for long periods of writing or study. It is also good to
                be
                able to shut a door when the day's work is over. If the office is in sight, the work seems to beckon
                at
                all hours. Peace of mind in being able to leave and forget a home office is very important.
                Disadvantages to this location include the isolation from what's going on in the home and the risk
                of
                other users accessing undesirable Internet sites.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>In a living room, family room, or dining room. Any of these rooms can house a home office,
                particularly
                when the computer-housing furniture is handsome and has doors that can close over the equipment and
                work
                in progress.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>A corner of a bedroom. This is an acceptable location when the use will not disturb other occupants
                and
                when the work does not get in the way of the user's ability to relax and leave the work. The
                advantage
                is being able to work in privacy, in any dress mode, and at any hour of the day. These features can
                also
                constitute disadvantages.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Multiple locations. It is not uncommon for adults who use their office for employment or
                professional
                projects to be unwilling to allow other users into their space and at their equipment. One solution
                to
                this dilemma is to plan for a child's computer station near the adult home office.</p>

                <h4>Dimensional Criteria </h4>
                <p>A workstation has three basic components: a task surface for writing or spreading materials,
                  an area for the computer, and filing cabinets for storing office materials and personal
                  belongings.
                  Below are generic dimensions for a workstation that can be modified to fit the needs of
                  specific users.</p>

                <figure>

              </li>

              <li>
                <h4>Types of Files </h4>
                <p>Files are available in two basic types: lateral or pedestal. Lateral files open on the wide end,
                  and their drawers extend the width of a letter, legal, or ledger file folder. Pedestals files open
                  from the narrow end and thus need extra room in front of the drawer to allow a full extension
                  into the open position.</p>
                <p>When specifying five-drawer files, it is better to choose lateral files for
                  easier access to materials in the top drawer. The table below is a general guide to file sizes;
                  note that each manufacturer has specific dimensions for their files. </p>

            <h3>The Library</h3>
          </header>
          <p>The library has been incorporated into many new homes in recent years. Even in this information age,
            with
            all the advantages of learning online, nothing can take the place of holding a book in hand or reading a
            book to a child. Bookcases can be beautiful, and a room with books can set the stage for a lifetime of
            literacy and learning, thereby enhancing the quality of life.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Location: A library can be a separate room with doors that close (consider pocket or French doors)
                or
                can be incorporated into the family room section of the great room or be a part of the home office
                or
                the master suite. </p>

              <p>A formal living room can double as a library, and so can a formal den just off the entryway. Formal
                dining tables are often underutilized, so dining rooms can make good libraries with the addition of
                an
                armchair or other comfortable seating beyond the dining table.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Bookcases can be ceiling to floor, located in segments around the room or in an open loft above a
                family or living area. Lower bookcases can be for children's books, memory books or scrapbooks, and
                educational learning toys. Upper bookcases can hold the treasured and valuable books that are for
                mature
                readers. </p>
              <p>Planning for custom cabinetry, shelves, and cupboards at this wish-list stage is a good idea so
                that
                the space will be adequate.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Good lighting is a must. Plan to wire for lighting that washes or spotlights the bookcases and
                gives
                good illumination to reading and study areas. Windows in a library give the eyes a chance to rest
                and to
                ponder what's being read and are a must for a computer station, where eyestrain should be relieved
                every
                few minutes by looking off into the distance for at least a few seconds.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Plan adequate space for comfortable seating. For solitary reading, consider support furnishings
                such as
                a footstool, table and lamp, and blanket or throw; for group reading sessions, plan to have one or
                more
                love seats or sofas with a coffee table and end tables for laying down books.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Consider a table or desk where the user can sit down and spread books out for research or homework.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>A fireplace is often desirable in a library to give warmth and emotional comfort.</p>
            </li>

            <h3>Kitchen and Great Room Planning</h3>
          </header>

          <p>The kitchen has long been the hub of the home, but in recent
            decades it has taken on a multifaceted role. </p>

          <p>No longer a room where all cabinetry has to match or the single working triangle is the norm, today's
            kitchen is the room where a majority of living and interacting takes place, and it is designed with
            space
            and equipment for a variety of activities. </p>

          <p>A great room is an area that comprises three formerly separate spaces: kitchen, dining, and family
            room.
          </p>

          <p>The following suggestions may be just a beginning; many good books on kitchen planning are available.
            Certified Kitchen Designers (CKDs) or Certified Kitchen and Bath Designers (CKBDs) can create optimum

            <h3>Features and Trends for Kitchens and Great Rooms</h3>
            <li>
              <p>With the advent of multiple users, kitchens may feature duplicate workstations, appliances, and
                fixtures, such as two ovens, two microwaves (one near the eating area, one in the cooking area), two
                refrigerators, two sinks, and two dishwashers. These may or may not be located next to each other;
                more
                likely they are not, except for the double ovens.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Multiple islands, one for food preparation and one for serving.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Drawers that contain warming ovens, and refrigerator drawers.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Cabinets that are architecturally beautiful, with various heights (stepped cabinetry), moldings,
                and
                pieces that look like furniture rather than cabinets. Thematic styles, such as Traditional, Modern,
                Arts
                and Crafts, Shaker, Country French, and American Country, provide the basis for wall, window, and
                floor
                coverings as well as furniture and accessories.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Walk-in pantry and cabinetry with special features such as rolling shelves and pull-out panels,
                bins,
                and work surfaces.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Universal design elements, such as surfaces that are safe to walk on, good lighting to decrease
                accidents, electricity located away from plumbing and water, lock-out options on ranges and ovens,
                water
                temperature regulating devices, and safe cooktops.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Appliance features are now so numerous that research and comparison is a must. Many models offer a
                chip
                that allows operation to be monitored on the home computer or handheld digital assistant. See the
                Web
                addresses for appliance companies on the Interiors website.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Special placement may be designed for cabinetry and appliances to accommodate the needs of the
                wheel-chair bound or ambulatory impaired. Likewise, think safety and empowerment through good
                planning
                for children and adolescents, who will use the kitchen when home alone.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>More than one working triangle and various working zones to meet the needs of multiple users.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The return of the Butlers Pantry. A separate room or open as an appendage to the kitchen, it
                contains
                cabinetry to hold larger serving dishes and extra tableware, and it often houses an extra sink,
                dishwasher, and refrigerator.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

                  <h4>KITCHENS </h4>
                </header>
                <p>The kitchen is the most difficult space in the house to design because appliances, equipment,
                  working
                  surfaces, and storage spaces must be carefully organized into a visually coherent and functional
                  whole. To ensure a smoothly functioning kitchen for more than one occupant, it is necessary to
                  synthesize a wide range of working and circulation scenarios. </p>
                <p> Fundamental to
                  kitchen planning is the placement of three elements: the refrigerator, the sink, and the stove.
                  These elements define the preparation zone, the washing zone, and the cooking zone. Together, the
                  zones define the three points of the "working triangle." </p>
                <p> In addition to mapping out a
                  safe and efficient working triangle, interior designers must also consider storage requirements
                  for the countless number of kitchen gadgets, dishes, and other accessories that are found in
                  the contemporary kitchen. </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <ul>
            <header>
              <h3>Zones and the Working Triangle</h3>
            </header>
            <p>Kitchen planning includes working arrangements in zones or work areas. Three zones are considered the
              basic working triangle:</p>

            <li>
              <p>The refrigerator zone</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The cooking zone (range and ovens)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The sink/cleanup zone</p>
            </li>

          </ul>

          <ul>
            <p>Total walking distance among these three areas should not be fewer than 3.65 metre (too
              crowded—produces
              frustration) and not more than 7.9 metre (too spread out—leads to exhaustion). Where multiple cooks
              work
              together, two basic work triangles may be planned. Other zones that add convenience and are considered
              essential to modern kitchens include any or all of the following:</p>
            <li>
              <p>Additional food storage zones</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Various specialized food preparation zones</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>A second cooking zone and/or a quick-cooking zone</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>A second cleanup/sink zone</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Tableware storage zone(s)</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Serving and service storage zone</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Cleaning supplies storage zone</p>
            </li>
            <p>These zones should be planned for the convenience and consideration of the family members who cook
              and
              should be laid out logically according to individual needs. </p>
            <br><br>

                  <p>The layouts that follow describe how the working triangle might be best
                    arranged for the size and shape of a particular room. </p>

                <li>
                  <h4>Single-Wall Kitchen </h4>

                  <p>The simplest kitchen organization is a single row of appliances and
                    counter space arranged against a wall. This layout is ideal for long
                    narrow rooms or one wall of a studio apartment where the kitchen
                    can either be screened off or made the central focus of the space. </p>

                  <p>The most practical plan should include counter space on both sides
                    of each major appliance. The refrigerator should be placed at one end
                    of the kitchen wall since it only needs counter space to one side-remember to specify a
                    refrigerator
                    with doors that open in the direction
                    of the adjacent counter space. </p>

                </li>

                <li>
                  <h4>Galley Kitchen </h4>
                  <p>A galley kitchen has two parallel runs of counters. The sink, dishwasher, and stove should be
                    located on the same side of the kitchen
                    (cooking and washing zones) and the refrigerator (the preparation
                    zone) should be located on the opposite wall. </p>
                  <p>The counters should be
                    at least 4 feet (1 219 millimeters) apart to provide adequate room for
                    more than one cook; if the kitchen is designed for only one cook, the
                    space between counters can be reduced to 3 feet (914 millimeters).
                    This layout is not recommended if other rooms are accessed through
                    the kitchen. </p>

                <li>
                  <h4>L-shaped or U-shaped Kitchens </h4>

                  <p>In these layouts, the counters and appliances are organized around
                    two or three walls. This arrangement can work in either small or large
                    spaces; however, in larger rooms the working triangle should be kept
                    within the optimal range of 12 to 22 feet (3658 to 6 705 millimeters). </p>

                  <p>Often in these arrangements, one leg of the L or the U forms a counter,
                    which is ideal for casual meals. In this scenario, it is best to design a
                    higher counter to separate the cooking zone from the eating zone. </p>

                  <h4>Island Kitchen</h4>
                  <p>A central workstation provides extra space for performing various culi-
                    nary tasks. Depending on the preferences of the cook, the island can
                    be designed for either preparing or cooking a meal. </p>
                  <p>Of all the layouts,
                    this arrangement encourages the most socializing in the kitchen. It is
                    best used in large rooms that allow enough space between counters
                    and island. </p>

                  <li>
                    <p>The washing zone is primarily made up of the sink and dishwasher. Ideally, the sink has two
                      compartments for washing and rinsing. The dishwasher should be placed immediately adjacent to
                      the sink but carefully located so that there is enough room to wash dishes in the sink
                      while the dishwasher is open. If the kitchen does not have a dishwasher, a drying rack should
                      be located above the counter so that it does not take up critical counter space. </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>It is also important to have a waste bin close to the sink for disposing of trash prior to
                      washing
                      dishes. Trash receptacles are often located behind a cabinet door and underneath the
                      sink to avoid visual clutter. Layout the cabinet for the trash can so that the cabinet door,
                      when
                      open, does block the open dishwasher. To avoid this conflict, incorporate the trash cabinet on
                      the opposite side of the sink from the dishwasher. </p>

                    <p>The preparation zone consists of the refrigerator and an adjacent counter-height workspace
                      for preparing food. The refrigerator should be placed in close proximity to the pantry so that
                      perishable and nonperishable foods are both easily accessible from the food preparation
                      workspace. There are many refrigerator/freezer combinations, each suitable for particular
                      spaces and types of users. The size of the refrigerator should be directly proportional to the
                      size of the kitchen. </p>

                    <p>Different types of tasks are best performed on different types of surfaces: For instance,
                      marble slabs are best for rolling out pastries, while wood counters are best for chopping.
                      These surfaces can be incorporated into the countertops or not, depending on the size of
                      kitchen, the preferences of the cook, and the budget. Other common counter surfaces include
                      granite, engineered quartz, concrete, stainless steel, wood, tile, acrylic solid surfacing,
                      and

                  <li>
                    <p>The cooking zone consists of the stove or a combination of a cooktop and wall oven. In
                      smaller kitchens, a stove is the most efficient choice. In larger kitchens, a separate cooktop
                      and wall oven is more desirable. In either arrangement, there must be sufficient
                      heat-resistant
                      counter space on both sides of the cooktop. Pots and pans should also be stored immediately
                      adjacent for easy access while cooking. A minimum aisle clearance of 36 inches (914
                      millimeters)
                      is required in front of the cooktop. </p>

                  <li>
                    <p>It is important to select the appropriate type of cooktop ventilation system: either a system
                      that recycles air through a charcoal filter or a system that removes smoke through a duct
                      vented to an exterior wall. Ventilating exhaust directly to the exterior is preferred but may
                      not
                      be practical in multifamily residential buildings. </p>

                      adjustable
                      feet to help align them with adjacent countertops. Most appliances have a built-in toe
                      space that ranges from 2 to 4 inches (51 to 102 millimeters) from the floor to accommodate the
                      front of the feet when reaching to the back of the appliance. Adjacent cupboards should be
                      designed with these basic dimensions in mind. </p>

                      hinges so that no one bangs their head on the doors when open. Lift-up doors can also solve
                      this problem. </p>

                    separate room organized around the
                    specific rituals of enjoying a meal. Regardless of the configuration, the dining room should be

        <div id="Laundry_Room">
          <header>
            <h2>Laundry Room</h2>
          </header>

          <p>Because the laundry room features permanent cabinetry and stationary appliances, foresight and
            flexibility
            in planning are required.</p>

          <p>Cabinets should contain shelves high enough for laundry detergents, whiteners, softeners, and other
            frequently used products and items. Counter space for folding clothes and a closet or rod for hanging
            permanent press clothing are important. </p>

          <p>The laundry room most often contains an ironing board—perhaps the built-in variety, which is excellent
            for
            saving space and keeping iron and board accessible and orderly.</p>

          <p>Drawers or cabinets can hold clothes to be ironed or mended as well as mending supplies. Sewing rooms
            are
            favorite combinations with laundry facilities because the ironing board is necessary for laundry and
            sewing
            and because mending often takes place before or after laundering. </p>

          <p>Sewing cabinetry can contain work surfaces that fold or slide behind doors, keeping the clutter out of
            sight when no sewing is taking place. The laundry room may also double with a mudroom and may contain
            closets or “lockers” for coats, winter gear, or sports equipment according to the season. </p>

          <p>The laundry/utility room may hold a food freezer, and the cabinetry may be organized for tools such as
            screwdrivers and pliers. If the laundry room is located near the kitchen, it could double as a storage
            room
            for bulky cooking appliances. </p>

          <header>
            <h3>There are at least five options of laundry location in space planning a home:</h3>
          </header>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Most typical is to locate the laundry near the kitchen. </p>

              <p>Some smaller homes and apartments have the washer and dryer in the kitchen itself, although
                ideally,
                the laundry needs to be in a place where clothes sorting can take place and where the door can be
                closed
                on the mess if necessary. </p>

              <p>Placing it near the kitchen is convenient since much of the daily household work revolves around
                the
                kitchen and only a few steps are needed to tend to the laundry in progress. In two-story homes where
                the
                laundry is on the main floor, careful planning can locate the laundry beneath at least one bathroom
                and
                over a clothes drop, which could empty into a cabinet above the washer and dryer.</p>

              <p>It is also possible to install two or three clothes drops so that sorting takes place as clothes
                are
                being dropped: one for whites, one for dark colors and jeans, and one for bright or light colors.
              </p>

              <p>This concept can be extended with the idea of drawers or baskets belonging to each family member.
                As
                clothes are folded, they are put into the drawer and that individual is responsible for taking the
                clothes and put-ting them away.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>A second location is in a basement. This location will keep the noise and clutter off the main
                floor
                but will necessitate climbing stairs with loads of dirty and clean laundry.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The third location is in the bedroom wing, next to the family bathroom. This location is popular in
                larger two-story homes and eliminates carrying laundry up and down stairs.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>A fourth location is in a hallway, but this may not be good planning since the clothes have to be
                sorted in the hall and a mess is created in the traffic pattern.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>In smaller homes and apartments, the bathroom may house the laundry. Theoretically this may be a
                good
                location since soiled clothing is often taken off at bath time. Some conflict could easily arise
                between
                functions and users, although in households of one or two users this is not an issue. Lack of
                adequate
                space for laundry activities may also be a disadvantage.
              </p>

          </ul>

            <h3>Master Suite Planning</h3>
          </header>

          <p>The master suite is one area in which money can be invested with an assurance of a return if the home
            is
            resold.</p>

          <p> A bit of upscale luxury in the master suite is a major trend, perhaps because two-career couples feel
            they
            need a private place to unwind after a long day. </p>

          <p>The master bedroom is often a master suite, consisting of various areas and adjoining rooms that become
            a
            mini-apartment supporting a variety of activities. Consider these options:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Incorporate space for seating or conversation. A single chair and ottoman or chaise lounge is a
                good
                alternative to sitting on the bed for reading or conversing. </p>
              <p>Consider a conversation area with sofas or love seats and comfortable chairs. Support them with end
                tables, lamps, magazine racks, or case piece furniture such as a bookshelf.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Wire and plan space for an entertainment unit. An armoire or television cabinet flanked by
                bookcases
                makes the master suite a place for private home theater. Surround-sound speakers wired into the
                ceiling
                for movies and stereo music are a luxury easily accomplished in new construction and remodeling.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>A small home office desk or hutch can be placed in the master suite. Placing a full-scale home
                office
                in a room adjoining or close by the master bedroom makes working at odd hours much less dreaded.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>An area just off the bedroom can accommodate exercise equipment, spa facilities, or a massage
                therapy
                room.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The master bedroom is a place for interior design creativity, where comfort, softness, seating area
                for
                conversation or media viewing, and private outdoors access may be included.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The master suite can accommodate a library that focuses on bookshelves, comfortable seating, and
                perhaps a fireplace or a window with a great view. In this room, the computer station may be played
                down, perhaps placed behind doors in a built-in or furniture unit.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Consider dual closets, or double walk-in closets, and built-in closet organizer shelves. Also
                consider
                a skylight or translucent glass windows in the closet areas or a window for fresh air.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Vaulted, domed, or high ceilings, fine millwork (moldings), and creatively planned spaces are other
                sought-after luxuries in master suites. Master bathrooms are an important part of the master suite.
              </p>
            </li>

            <h4>Consider:</h4>

            <li>
              <p>Luxury spa or whirlpool bathtub.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Separate roomy shower with dual heads at different heights, or water walls of multiple small jet
                spray
                heads. Luxury showers are often deep walk-in room-like areas. Amenities include surround-sound
                speakers
                for music, radio, or television, and television screens.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Warming towel bars.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Above counter lavatory bowls (sinks) and extensive use of stone or tile.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Where the bath area is large and open, the toilet is often inside a small room or “closet” with
                good
                lighting and ventilation fans.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Closet or dressing areas adjoining the master bathroom.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Vaulted ceilings and creative shapes can make this area seem larger than it is.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Consider double vanities, custom-built for the height of each person. Vanities may be in separate
                areas, with large mirrors and custom storage for each user's needs.</p>

              <h3>BEDROOMS</h3>
              <p>The most important goal in designing a bedroom is to establish a comfortable relationship
                between the occupants and their bed and between the bed and the room at large. Because
                people spend an average of six to eight hours a day in the bedroom, the space must engender
                feelings both of relaxation and security. The design of bedrooms should also accommodate
                activities such as reading and functions such as storage for personal belongings. </p>

                  <p>The bed is the only indispensable piece of furniture

            <h3>Family Bathrooms</h3>
          </header>
          <p>Family bathrooms are often a point of contention, with one person locking the door and staying for
            lengths
            of time, often just grooming, while others grow impatient. Some ideas to help alleviate the tension are
            listed here:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Compartmentalize the bathroom with a pocket, folding, or swinging door between the vanity and
                bath/toilet area.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Place the toilet in a closet.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Separate the vanities; lengthen the vanity; consider double sinks.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Place a vanity with sink in each bedroom.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Place a small bathroom between each two bedrooms with an access door on each side. This works
                especially well when the bathroom contains the toilet and bathtub or shower and the vanities are in
                a
                hallway or bedroom.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Put the bathtub and shower in separate areas.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Small bathroom spaces can appear larger by the use of increased ceiling height, plumbing fixtures
                without bulky cabinetry, and well-placed mirrors.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Upscale or luxury homes usually feature a full-scale private bathroom with each bedroom. This plan
                makes ideal guest suites and is a boon to family harmony when the children marry and come home for a
                visit with their own children or when an aged parent comes to stay in the home.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Be sure to plan doorways so that plumbing fixtures are not in plain view.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Many styles of bathtubs, showers, vanities, and sinks are available. Website addresses for plumbing
                fixture companies are listed on the Interiors website.</p>

                <h3>Design Considerations for Bathroom</h3>
              </header>
              <li>
                <h4>Two-Person Use </h4>
                <p>Placing lavatory, bath, and toilet in a single space is not ideal when the bathroom is shared.
                  When two people commonly use a bathroom suite at the same time, an enclosed toilet or a
                  separate toilet room should be considered if space allows. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Wall and Floor Finishes</h4>
                <p>Numerous options are available for floor and wall finishes for a bathroom, from ceramic tile to
                  glass tile to stone. Wall finishes need to be water-resistant with a waterproof substrate to 72
                  inches (1 829 millimeters) above finish floor and floors need to be slip-resistant. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Lighting</h4>
                <p>Bathrooms should include both general room lighting and task lighting at the mirror and over
                  the shower. The best mirror lighting is at the sides via wall sconces, which prevents shadows
                  on the face. Wall sconces should be placed approximately 66 inches (1 676 millimeters) above
                  the floor and minimally 30 inches (762 millimeters) apart. </p>
                <p>Avoid using ceiling-mounted fixtures
                  as the sole source of light. If the bathroom is too small and there is not enough room for side
                  lighting, consider introducing a light cove above the mirror.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h4>Shower Controls </h4>
                <p>The many recent advances in shower design can make the selection of shower controls con-
                  fusing. Here basic elements are defined: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <h5>Spray Showerhead:</h5>
                    <p>Traditional showerhead that can be used in a shower enclosure or as part
                      of a tub-shower combination. Mounted to the wall, it comes in a variety of spray patterns.
                      Supplemental hand-held showers allow for more flexibility. </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <h5>Shower Diverter:</h5>
                    <p>Valve that redirects water from a spout to a showerhead or hand-held shower.
                      A two-way diverter is for a bathtub and shower combination. These diverters can be as simple
                      as a pull-tab on the tub spout that redirects the water flow from one function to the other.
                      A three-way diverter, which redirects the water flow among tub, showerhead, and hand-held
                      shower, is a separate control value mounted on the wall. </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <h5>Thermostatic-controlled Valve:</h5>
                    <p>Valve that allows the water temperature to be set, while controlling the amount of water
                      coming
                      through the system at a precise temperature.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h5>High-flow Valve:</h5>
                    <p>Valve that controls custom designed showers with multiple spray heads. At
                      this end of the spectrum, the various manufacturers offer many features that are unique to
                      their system. </p>
                  </li>

            considerations for children's spaces:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Small bedrooms that adjoin a playroom allow for a separation of sleep and play areas.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Larger bedrooms that are carefully planned with action or move-about space make a child's world
                private.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Planning a desk with good lighting and perhaps built-in shelves encourages children to study. Most
                parents will want each child to have computer access. Not all, however, will choose to connect
                children's computers to the Internet, as there are concerns about online content that conflicts with
                family values and about the effect of extensive Internet use on children's development of social
                skills
                and family relationships.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Luxuries such as a telephone and television are also personal considerations, influenced by
                concerns
                about unmonitored telephone use and television viewing. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The amount of family interaction desired versus the autonomy and indulgence a child is afforded
                should
                be an open matter of discussion, with research to back the decision.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Surround-sound speakers for the inevitable stereo system are an option that must be planned in
                advance.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>As alternatives to a plethora of electronic devices, con-sider these ideas for bedrooms or
                playrooms:
                built-in fantasy play areas with climbing devices and a slide; a performing stage; a wall of
                full-length
                mirrors for dancing; a toy car racetrack or a table for model trains and jigsaw puzzles; built-in
                shelves for books, with comfortable and inviting seating such as chairs, love seats, or cushioned
                and
                pillowed window seats. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Children's play areas can also contain organized closets with compartmentalized shelves and drawers
                for
                educational toys and experimental science kits.
              </p>
            </li>

            <p>This area was specially designed for children. Cubical storage is perfect for toys and books, which
              can
              be rotated onto the wide low table that gives plenty of playing and reading space. </p>

            <p> The playhouse is located beneath a stair-well, and the large cabinet holds the television, media
              equipment.

            <h3>Indoor & Outdoor Living</h3>
          </header>

          <p>Of all the rooms in a house, the living room has the fewest constraints since it requires neither
            appliances, nor plumbing fixtures, nor storage. As a result, interior designers have a
            great deal of freedom in terms of the character and configuration of the space. The living room
            should be designed to reflect the particular lifestyle of a family. </p>

                <h4>Typical Furniture Dimensions </h4>
                <ul>

                  <li>
                    <p>Specific functional requirements and the size and shape of the room will help set the agenda
                      for selecting and arranging the most appropriate furniture. Below are the dimensions of
                      typical
                      living room furniture. </p>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <p>Be mindful that the dimensions of specific pieces may vary from the typical sizes. Furniture
                      that
                      diverges widely in dimension from these examples may be uncomfortable and impractical,
                      however.

                    <p>The distance between chairs and sofas can influence the behavior of the occupants of a
                      space. Two people sitting across from each other must be within a specific dimensional range
                      for conversation to be comfortable. The behavior of larger groups of people around and across
                      a coffee table is also affected by the relative intimacy of the furniture arrangement. </p>

              <li>
                <h4>Dual Axis</h4>
                <p>A cross axis will focus attention toward the center
                  of a room, while other features become a backdrop. </p>

                  Using local symmetry can

                  casual atmosphere within

          <p>Whether a minuscule deck, a broad porch, or an expansive lawn, in many climates and seasons the
            outdoors
            offers an ideal place to converse and connect with family and friends. Fresh air and sunshine promote
            good
            health. </p>

          <p>Watching the children or pets play while visiting is a pleasant pastime. A well-designed yard can be an
            extension of the living spaces. Consider these advantages of connecting the indoor environment to the
            outdoors:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>The visual expanse of an outdoor living space seen through windows and doors makes the interior
                seem
                larger.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>A pleasant view, even of a small patio or backyard, can make indoor living psychologically more
                enjoyable.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>An indoor-outdoor traffic flow and outdoor seating can at least double the space for entertaining
                and
                gracious family living.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Outdoor living spaces may in-corporate many amenities: durable well-designed furniture; beautiful
                architectural features such as columns, roofed porches, and well-chosen flooring materials; even
                area
                rugs, art, and accessories. </p>

              <p>
                A whirl-pool spa or swimming pool, perhaps with a retractable roof; a
                fireplace or upscale cooking grill; or even a small kitchenette containing a refrigerator and
                microwave
                oven behind lockable cabinet doors can be a part of the outdoor living experience.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Wiring on the outside of the home allows for working on a computer laptop or notebook. A DSL or
                telephone jack makes connecting to the Internet possible while sipping lemonade on the porch.</p>

            <h3>Storage</h3>
          </header>
          <p>Storage is a precious commodity; it fills up so quickly and is difficult to empty because possessions
            are
            hard to part with. A cardinal rule is that storage should be located at the point of first or most
            frequent
            use.</p>

          <p>It has also been suggested that in order to determine real storage needs, one should list things owned
            and
            their corresponding sizes and then list where these items should be stored and what size that storage
            area
            should be. </p>

          <ul>
            <p>Storage zones are desirable in specific locations:</p>
            <li>
              <p>The kitchen should include storage for dry goods (such as a wall or walk-in pantry) and ample
                storage
                for pots and pans, small appliances, serving bowls, informal and formal plates and dishes and
                glasses
                (stemware), silverware and utensils, linens, soaps and cleansers, and cleaning appliances (brooms,
                mops,
                or vacuums), all located within convenient reach.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The laundry facility should have storage for extra soap, bleach, softener, and other cleaning
                preparations.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The front hall closet is for family and/or guest coats. Depending on the weather and the lifestyle,
                there may be a place for wet outerwear such as raincoats, umbrellas, or boots. </p>
              <p>It may not always be possible, however, to accommodate all the guests’ coats, scarves, and gloves
                when
                a sizable group is being entertained. In this case, the outerwear might be placed in a den or on a
                bed.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Closets, lockers, a walk-in closet, or a wall of hooks near the back entrance, garage entrance, or
                mudroom are for winter gear (coats, boots, school bags) and individual sports gear, again depending
                on
                lifestyle.</p>

              <p>In the summer, such an area could double for summer sports gear: tennis, baseball, and soccer
                equipment
                and even swimming towels and gear.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>A closet for the vacuum cleaner should be placed where it is needed. In two-story houses, a vacuum
                might be located in a closet on each floor.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Linen closets are usually located in a hall near bedrooms to hold extra sheets, pillowcases,
                pillows,
                and blankets.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Bathroom storage needs include paper goods, personal hygiene sundries, and extra towels, as well as
                cleaning supplies.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Bedrooms are often shortchanged in storage. Sizable, compartmentalized closets will be appreciated.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Any area where a hobby is performed requires individualized storage.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Home offices need closets, shelves, and/or units that can hold reference books, fi les, paper, and
                other supplies. The personal computer demands certain storage items such as printer paper and disks.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The family room or entertainment room will need storage for items such as cassettes, records,
                compact
                discs, and videotapes.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The library, often combined with a home office or an-other room, will need plenty of shelves and
                perhaps some storage with locking doors for valuable books or papers.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The tool shed is a place to store lawn and garden tools and equipment, and tools for use in other
                maintenance projects.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Where no tool shed or yard storage shed exists, the garage is often used for lawn and garden
                equipment,
                tools, bicycles, and a myriad of items too bulky for home storage. With careful planning, the garage
                that is also a storage area can be organized to avoid a cluttered appearance.</p>
