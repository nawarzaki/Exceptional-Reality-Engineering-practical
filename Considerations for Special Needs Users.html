      <h2>Considerations for Special Needs Users</h2>

      <div id="for_Special_Needs">

        <p>Universal design implies that well-planned designs will meet the needs of every user without drawing
          attention to persons with disabilities. For example, older buildings with many steps are not accessible
          to
          regular wheelchair users. Ramps can be installed to make the buildings accessible, but the ramp is a
          special
          addition, and while it is functional, it draws attention to the wheelchair user, who must employ a
          different
          route of entry. New facilities designed on level grade, with automatic sliding doors where all can enter
          in
          the same manner, are examples of universal design—everyone is accommodated without drawing attention to
          distinctions of ability.</p>
        <br>

        <p>
          These sliding doors operate by overhead sensors that detect movement, opening for all users without
          calling
          attention to disability, qualifying them as universal design.
        </p>

        </figure> <br><br>

        <img src="images/lever hand.jpg" alt="lever_hand" style="height:48%; width:33%">
        <figcaption>A lever door handle is a universal design solution for those with limited hand strength, as it
          eliminates the gripping, twisting action required for the standard door knob. Lever handles are also
          easy to
          use when one`s hands are full, by leaning on the handle with the forearm or elbow.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <br><br>

        <div id="Steps_and_Ramps">
          <h3>Steps and Ramps</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p> Many ambulant-disabled users find stairs easier to negotiate than ramps (which are necessary for
                the
                chair bound). Consequently, a minimum slope for ramps is best, with a rise of 1 foot for every 12
                feet
                of length (1:12).</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Steps should not have protruding nosing that will catch the toes of those with stiff legs,
                braces, or
                other leg problems.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>All ramps and steps should be well lit, with focus lighting directed at walking hazards. Whenever
                possible, they should be covered to remain dry and free from ice.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The top of a handrail should be 87cm to 96cm above the ramp or steps.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Handrails should be oval or round, with 4cm hand clearance between the rails and the wall. This
                will provide ease of grip but will prevent the hand or wrist from slipping between the handrail
                and
                the
                wall if the person loses balance.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The handrail should have a gripping surface of 2.5cm to 4cm and should not be interrupted by
                newel
                posts or other elements.</p>
            </li>

        </div> <br><br>

        <div id="Passage_and_Turning">
          <h3>Passage and Turning</h3>
          <ul>

            <li>
              <p> For a single wheelchair, 82 cm is minimum clearance at a point such as a door (91.5 cm is
                better), and 91.5 cm is minimum clearance in a continuous passage (105cm to 122cm is better).
                Minimum
                clearance for two chairs to pass each other is 152cm. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The space required by a wheelchair to make a 180-degree turn is a clear space of 152cm.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The clear floor space required for a wheelchair is 76 by 122cm.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The force needed to push a door open should not exceed 8 pounds of pressure.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p> Lever-type door handles are easier to operate than round doorknobs, which are slippery and hard
                to
                operate with limited strength. Thumb-latch fixtures are equally hard to operate with limited
                strength
                or
                motion.</p>

              <p> A kick plate at the bottom of a door protects the door from the impact
                of a wheelchair`s footrest.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p> Floors should have a flat, nonskid surface. If carpet is used, it should be securely attached,
                without
                a cushion or pad. Pile depth should not be more than 1.25cm, since anything with a deeper pile
                makes
                passage difficult.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p> Flooring materials should be flush, since a change in depth greater than 1.25cm forms a barrier.

        <div id="Kitchens_Considerations">
          <div>
            <p>When designing a kitchen for a multifamily dwelling, interior designers must determine the
              jurisdictional requirements for their specific project because they can vary depending on the
              type of project and the number of units.</p>
            <p>The layout for an accessible kitchen follows the same
              principles as that of a standard kitchen, with additional criteria regarding maneuverability. In
              general, clear floor space is required at fixtures and appliances, and the shape and size will
              depend on whether the approach is parallel or perpendicular. </p>
          </div> <br><br>

          <h3>Kitchens</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p> All areas of the kitchen should be accessible to a frontal approach as well as a parallel
                approach
                by
                a wheelchair. This means an access space of no less than 76cm by 122cm, or a minimum distance of
                122cm
                between opposing elements. In a U-shaped kitchen, the distance should be increased to 150cm.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Varying countertop heights are recommended. A low counter near the sink for food preparation is
                helpful. Heights of 71cm, 82cm, and 91.5cm are good, with a maximum depth of 61cm so that items on
                the counter-top can be easily reached.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Upper cabinets should be adjustable to several heights. Eight inches above the counter is the
                minimum
                for very small users.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Handles on upper cabinets should be mounted a maximum of 122cm from the floor, with those on
                lower
                cabinets a minimum of 70cm from the floor.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Leaving space under the counter, especially at the sink, allows a wheel-chair to approach.
                Hot-water
                pipes should be insulated so that the wheel-chair user will not be burned.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The sink controls should be mounted on the side or no more than 46cm from the front of the
                counter for easy reach.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>A toe-kick space under cabinets should be 30.5cm high and 20cm deep to accommodate a wheelchair
                footrest.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Pull-out trays allow better access than standard drawers and shelves.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Wall-mounted, side-opening ovens and microwaves allow wheelchair access.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Cooktops should have staggered burners so that the users do not have to reach over a hot front
                burner
                to access a back burner.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Cooktop controls should be front mounted for easy reach by a seated person.</p>
            </li> <br><br>

            <li>
              <p>Doors should be at least 91.5cm wide (preferably 100cm). Pocket doors keep the space clear and
                make
                access easier.</p>

            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Faucets at the sink should also be lever controlled as well as side mounted. Water temperature

              <li>
                <p>Carpet and fabric wall coverings reduce noise reverberation and improve the acoustics for the

              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Good lighting is imperative for adequate decoding of manual communication and lip reading.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Good natural light helps visually and also creates the psychological feeling of openness and
                  well-being.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Furniture arranged in a semicircle or U shape facilitates signing and lip reading by providing
                  clear
                  sight lines from speaker to listener.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>A round dining table is better than a rectangular table because it provides clear sight lines.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Visual signals such as flashing lights can provide important visual cues. The lights are
                  activated
                  by the telephone, doorbell, alarm clock, fire alarm/smoke detector, or a crying baby. The lights
                  can
                  be placed in panels at strategic locations throughout the house.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Special phone systems are available for the hearing impaired. These systems are called TDD, an
                  acronym for telecommunication device for the deaf. The TDD includes a screen and keyboard and
                  will

              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Because of the addition of extra electronic devices, ad-equate outlets should be planned to

            <h3>Design for Visual Impairment</h3>

            <ul>

              <li>
                <p>The visually impaired may need tactile warning of danger. Door handles may be textured to
                  indicate
                  a
                  dangerous area beyond the door, and landings and curbs can be textured to indicate steps or
                  changes
                  of
                  grade.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Outdoors, hanging or projecting objects (even plants and tree branches) that extend into the
                  path
                  of
                  the blind person are dangerous because they cannot be detected with a cane.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Handrails should extend 30cm beyond the end of a stairway, even if this means extending the
                  rail
                  around a corner. Where there is more than one story, a hand-rail should extend continuously from
                  floor
                  to floor, rather than stopping at the landing.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Signage is important. Small groups of letters and numbers can be easily read with the fingers,
                  but
                  larger groups of letters and long texts are difficult for the blind to read.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Persons born blind learn Braille, while most persons blinded later in life do not. Signage
                  should
                  include both letters/numbers and Braille symbols.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>To be useful, tactile signals and signage should be uniform throughout a building.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Audible signals for the blind are helpful at crosswalks, in elevators, and for emergency
                  systems
                  such as smoke detectors/ fire alarms.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Gas cooktops tend to be better for the blind because the gas makes a sound as it burns. In
                  addition,
                  electric elements retain heat after they are turned off, which can be dangerous. Controls should
                  be
                  mounted where the blind will not have to reach over the flame or coils to operate the cooktop.
                  Elements, too, should be arranged to avoid reaching over one to get to the other.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>A lip on the counter may be helpful in preventing objects from being pushed off the edge.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Furniture should have rounded corners and edges, and some padding of table edges may be
                  advisable.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>A hook next to electrical outlets might be desirable to hang a plug where it can be found
                  easily.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Changes of grade in flooring materials are obstacles for the blind and should be avoided.</p>
