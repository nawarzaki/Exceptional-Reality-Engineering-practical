      <h1>ACOUSTICS</h1>
    </header>

    <div id="Acoustics_elements">
      <p>Acoustics is the branch of physics that deals with the
        production, control, transmission, reception, and effects of
        sound. Sound may be defined as the sensation stimulated
        in the organs of hearing by mechanical radiant energy
        transmitted as longitudinal pressure waves through the air or
        other medium.</p>

      <ul>

        <li>
          <p>Sound waves are longitudinal pressure waves in air or an
            elastic medium producing an audible sensation.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Sound travels through air at approximately 1087' (0.3 km)
            per second at sea level, through water at approximately
            4500' (1.4 km) per second, through wood at approximately
            11,700' (3.6 km) per second, and through steel at
            approximately 18,000' (5.5 km) per second.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The threshold of pain is the level of sound intensity high
            enough to produce the sensation of pain in the human ear,
            usually around 130 dB.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Decibel (dB) is a unit for expressing the relative pressure or
            intensity of sounds on a uniform scale from 0 for the least
            perceptible sound to about 130 for the average threshold
            of pain.</p>

          <p>Decibel measurement is based on a logarithmic
            scale since increments of sound pressure or intensity
            are perceived as equal when the ratio between successive
            changes in intensity remains constant. </p>

          <p>The decibel
            levels of two sound sources, therefore, cannot be added
            mathematically: e.g., 60 dB + 60 dB = 63 dB, not 120 dB.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p> The threshold of hearing is the minimum sound pressure
            capable of stimulating an auditory sensation, usually 20
            micropascals or zero dB.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The audio frequency is a range of frequencies from 15 Hz to
            20,000 Hz audible to the normal human ear. Hertz (Hz) is
            the SI unit of frequency, equal to one cycle per second.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Doppler effect is an apparent shift in frequency occurring
            when an acoustic source and listener are in motion relative
            to each other, the frequency increasing when the source and
            listener approach each other and decreasing when they move
            apart.</p>
        </li>

      <p>Acoustical design is the planning, shaping,
        finishing, and furnishing of an enclosed space to
        establish the acoustical environment necessary for
        distinct hearing of speech or musical sounds.
        <br>

      <ul>

        <li>
          <p> Reflecting surfaces are nonabsorptive
            surfaces from which incident sound is
            reflected, used to redirect sound in a
            space. To be effective, a reflecting surface
            should have a least dimension equal to or
            greater than the wavelength of the lowest
            frequency of the sound being reflected.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p> Diffracted sound is airborne sound
            waves bent by diffraction around
            an obstacle in their path.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Reflected sound is the return of
            unabsorbed airborne sound after
            striking a surface, at an angle
            equal to the angle of incidence.</p>
        </li>

        <br>

        <br>

        <li>
          <p>Airborne sound travels directly from
            a source to the listener. In a room,
            the human ear always hears direct
            sound before it hears reflected sound.
            As direct sound loses intensity,
            the importance of reflected sound
            increases.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Attenuation is a decrease in
            energy or pressure per unit
            area of a sound wave, occurring
            as the distance from the
            source increases as a result
            of absorption, scattering, or
            spreading in three dimensions.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Reverberation is the persistence of a sound
            within an enclosed space, caused by multiple
            reflection of the sound after its source has
            stopped. Reverberation time is the time in
            seconds required for a sound made in an enclosed
            space to diminish by 60 dB.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Resonance is the intensification and prolongation
            of sound produced by sympathetic vibration, the
            vibration induced in one body by the vibrations of
            exactly the same period in a neighboring body.</p>
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
          <p> Echoes are the repetitions of a sound produced
            by the reflection of sound waves from an
            obstructing surface, loud enough and received
            late enough to be perceived as distinct from the
            source; echoes may occur when parallel surfaces
            are more than 60' (18 m) apart.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p> Flutter is a rapid succession of echoes caused
            by the reflection of sound waves back and forth
            between two parallel surfaces, with sufficient
            time between each reflection to cause the
            listener to be aware of separate, discrete signals.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p> Focusing is the convergence of sound waves
            reflected from a concave surface.</p>

        <h2>SOUND CONTROL</h2>
      </header>


      <p>Noise is any sound that is unwanted, annoying, or discordant, or
        that interferes with one's hearing of something. Whenever possible,
        undesirable noises should be controlled at their source.</p>



      <ul>

        <li>
          <p>Block flanking paths that transmit sound through plenum spaces and
            along such interconnecting structures as ductwork or piping.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Select mechanical equipment with low sone ratings. Sone is a
            subjective unit of loudness equal to that of a 1000 Hz reference
            sound having an intensity of 40 dB.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Use resilient mountings and flexible bellows to isolate equipment
            vibrations from the building structure and supply systems to reduce
            the transmission of vibration and noise to the supporting structure.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Inertia block is a heavy concrete base for vibrating mechanical
            equipment, used in conjunction with vibration isolators to increase
            the mass of the equipment and decrease the potential for vibratory
            movement.</p>

      <h1>Noise Reduction</h1>

      <p>The required reduction in noise level from one space to another depends
        on the level of the sound source and the level of the sound's intrusion
        that may be acceptable to the listener. The perceived or apparent sound
        level in a space is dependent on:</p>

      <ul>

        <li>
          <p> The transmission loss through the wall, floor, and ceiling
            construction;</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The absorptive qualities of the receiving space;</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p> The level of masking or background sound, which increases the
            threshold of audibility for other sounds in its presence.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Background noise or ambient sound is the sound normally present
            in an environment, usually a composite of sounds from both exterior
            and interior sources, none of which are distinctly identifiable by the
            listener.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>White noise is an unvarying, unobtrusive sound having the same
            intensity for all frequencies of a given band, used to mask or
            obliterate unwanted sound.</p>

          <p>Noise criteria curve is one of a series of curves representing the
            sound pressure level across the frequency spectrum for background
            noise that should not be exceeded in various environments. Higher
            noise levels are permitted at the lower frequencies since the human
            ear is less sensitive to sounds in this frequency region.</p>

          <h2>Transmission Loss</h2>
        </header>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Transmission loss (TL) is a measure of the performance
              of a building material or construction assembly in
              preventing the transmission of airborne sound, equal to
              the reduction in sound intensity as it passes through the
              material or assembly when tested at all 1/3 octave band
              center frequencies from 125 to 4000 Hz: expressed in
              decibels.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Average TL is a single-number rating of the performance of
              a building material or construction assembly in preventing
              the transmission of airborne sound, equal to the average
              of its TL values at nine test frequencies.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Sound transmission class (STC) is a single-number rating
              of the performance of a building material or construction
              assembly in preventing the transmission of airborne
              sound, derived by comparing the laboratory TL test curve
              for the material or assembly to a standard frequency
              curve. </p>

            <p>The higher the STC rating, the greater the sound-
              isolating value of the material or construction. An open
              doorway has an STC rating of 10; normal construction
              has STC ratings from 30 to 60; special construction is
              required for STC ratings above 60.</p>
          </li>
          <br><br>

          <p>Three factors enhance the TL rating of a construction
            assembly: separation into layers, mass, and
            absorptive capacity.</p>
          <br>

          <li>
            <p> Staggered-stud partitions for reducing sound
              transmission between rooms are framed with two
              separate rows of studs arranged in zigzag fashion
              and supporting opposite faces of the partition,
              sometimes with a fiberglass blanket between.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> Resilient mounting is a system of flexible supports
              or attachments, such as resilient channels and
              clips, that permits room surfaces to vibrate
              normally without transmitting the vibratory
              motions and associated noise to the supporting
              structure.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Air spaces increase transmission loss.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p> Seal pipe penetrations and other openings
              and cracks in walls and floors to maintain the
              continuity of sound isolation.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Acoustic mass resists the transmission of sound
              by the inertia and elasticity of the transmitting
              medium. In general, the heavier and more dense
              a body, the greater its resistance to sound
              transmission.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Absorption coefficient is a measure of the
              efficiency of a material in absorbing sound at a
              specified frequency, equal to the fractional part
              of the incident sound energy at that frequency
              absorbed by the material.</p>

          <h2>Impact Noise</h2>
        </header>

        <ul>

          <p>mpact noise is structure-borne sound generated by physical
            impact, as by footsteps or the moving of furniture.</p>

          <li>
            <p> Impact insulation class (IIC) is a single-number rating
              of the performance of a floor-ceiling construction in
              preventing the transmission of impact noise. The higher
              the IIC rating, the more effective is the construction
              in isolating impact noise. The IIC rating replaces the
              previously used Impact Noise Rating (INR) and is
              approximately equal to the INR rating + 51 dB for a
              given construction.</p>
