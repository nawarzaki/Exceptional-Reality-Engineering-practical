        <h2>Space Planning and the Principles And Elements of Design
        </h2>
      </header>


      <p>Effective space planning incorporates careful consideration of the principles and elements of design in
        order
        to create interiors that are pleasing and effective. And since people are the most important ingredient of
        the
        space, the proportion and scale in particular should always be judged according to that of the human body.
        With this in mind, the space can be planned to fit the purpose. A very large or grand scale-seen in places
        such as cathedrals, hotel lobbies, or open atrium areas of office buildings—is awesome compared to the
        human
        scale. </p>

      <p>But in these places, that overwhelming feeling serves a purpose—to give a different perspective or
        alternative to viewing space. The perspective may create a feeling of reverence, awe, contemplation, or
        simply
        relief from closed, small-scale quarters.</p>

      <p>However, the overall size or scale of the space best relates to the human frame in most interiors.
        Typical
        sizes for living areas in homes that have proved their effectiveness in relating to the human scale.</p>

      <div id="Living_with_Less_Space">

          <h3>Living with Less Space</h3>
        </header>

        <p>Smaller seems to be the direction of the future. This is not necessarily bad, since large spaces demand
          upkeep and extra furnishings and can pose not only cleaning burdens but security problems as well.</p>

        <p>In a home where the cost disallows space for every desired purpose, some rooms can serve two or more
          functions. For example, a little-used but desired formal dining room can double as a library; the home
          office or den could act as a guest room. The most dramatic multiuse area, however, is the great room, a
          term
          taken from medieval England when the great hall was the place where dining, entertaining, conversation,
          and
          sleeping all took place. </p>

        <p>Today's great room frequently includes a kitchen; a snack bar or island for both food preparation and
          eating; a seating conversation area, often grouped around a fireplace, window, or other focal point; an
          entertainment system of television/video/stereo equipment; perhaps a sit-down eating area (in lieu of
          the
          formal dining room); and a desk for study, scheduling, and handling personal finances, which may contain
          space for a personal computer and filing system.</p>

          <h3>Stretching Space</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Because of smaller spaces in today's homes, it is often desirable to make spaces seem larger than they
          actually are. </p>

        <p>A space-saving device is a method of making space appear larger, for example:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>The use of open plans with few structural walls. Many homes have been remodeled to remove walls.
              However, a general contractor should be consulted first to determine if walls can safely be removed
              without posing a threat to the structural soundness of the building. In no case should load-bearing
              walls be removed.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Vertical space, accomplished with vaulted (high, angled) ceilings, 1½- or 2-story ceilings, or
              skylights.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Half walls that allow visual and audible communication to the upper area of an adjoining room.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Extensive use of glass windows, doors, and walls. In the past, glass building materials admitted
              too
              much heat and cold. Now, however, we are able to control solar gain and heat loss through new glass
              types, high-performance window film, shading devices, and energy-conserving window treatments.</p>
          </li>


          <p>Once the building is complete, decorative space-saving devices can also seem to expand space. These
            devices include the following:</p>

          <li>
            <p>Light colors seem to recede, as do dull colors.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Smooth textures expand space more than do rough textures.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Properly used mirrors can expand space if, for example, the mirror reflects a view out a window and
              not
              a decoratively furnished or busy, patterned area.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Floor-to-ceiling draperies make walls look taller, as do top treatments and strong vertical lines
              in
              the window treatments.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Long vertical or horizontal moldings carry the eye and expand visual space, giving the impression
              of
              greater height or width, respectively.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Plain, wall-to-wall floor coverings will give the impression of greater floor area, particularly in
              contrast to patterned or layered floor coverings.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Furnishings that are small scale, are lighter in color, use small or no patterns, have legs rather
              than
              upholstered skirts or solid wood to the floor, and utilize glass or other see-through materials will
              also help expand small spaces. A common design error is to place large, patterned upholstered pieces
              and
              large-scale wooden furniture in small spaces.
            </p>

          <h3>Making Large Spaces Seem Smaller</h3>
        </header>
        <p>Too much space can be as big a dilemma as too little space. Feelings of unfriendliness and insecurity
          are
          common in areas that are larger than human scale in height and/or horizontal space.</p>

        <p>Noises are often amplified, or they may echo or reverberate, particularly when there are large areas of
          hard surfaces. Communication can be difficult because of this. Another pitfall is a lack of privacy and
          the
          inability to physically or emotionally claim an area as one's own.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/Space Planning and the Principles And Elements Design/Rich browns surround.png"
            alt="Rich browns surround" style="height:45% ;width:40%">
          <figcaption>Rich browns surround this free-standing tub and
            shower, making the space appear small, cozy, and luxurious. </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Space-reducing devices are largely the converse of space-saving devices. The following suggestions call
          for
          groupings and techniques to make the space become more human in scale and more friendly:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Furniture can be arranged into several conversation or function groupings.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Area rugs, such as colored and patterned Oriental or designer rugs, can define groupings.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Darker colors on walls, floors, and ceilings make space seem smaller, as do patterns or heavy rough
              textures.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Space will appear to decrease with large-scale furniture such as upholstery with skirts, or the
              overstuffed variety; wood furniture that is heavy (literally); furniture that is solid right to the
              floor; and tall and wide pieces.</p>
          </li>

        </ul> <br><br>

        <div>
          <header>
            <h3>Trafﬁc Patterns</h3>
          </header>
          <p>Traffic patterns are also referred to as circulation or traffic flow. A traffic pattern is the
            repeatedly
            used walking path from room to room or area to area. </p>

          <p>Traffic patterns are necessary and unavoidable and require careful evaluation as an important part of
            space planning. Traffic patterns may be drawn in lines and arrows on the diagram or floor plan,
            indicating
            where people will be walking or where objects will be moved regularly through the space. These traffic
            patterns should be left free and kept as direct as possible.</p>

          <ul>
            <p>In a home, major traffic patterns typically lead from:</p>

            <li>
              <p>Front door to a central circulation system that leads to all areas of the house</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Garage to kitchen for carrying groceries.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Garage to hall closet, service area, or mudroom.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Kitchen to formal, informal, and private living areas</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Kitchen to dining room.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Kitchen to service areas and entry areas.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Laundry areas to bedrooms.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Bedrooms to bathrooms.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Back door to kitchen, mudroom, or service area some pitfalls to avoid in arranging traffic
                patterns
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Rooms that act as hallways, where a room must be crossed to reach another room.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Door locations that force circulation through conversation furniture groupings.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Areas too small for furniture and circulation.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Areas where bathroom fixtures, beds, or other private spaces are open to view</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Traffic flow through work areas that tend to be untidy, such as the kitchen sink or laundry area
              </p>
            </li>

            <p>Traffic patterns must be planned for adequate width. Hallways and stairs in homes have typically
              been
              0.91 metre
              to 1.05 metre wide. However, a 1.20 metre wide corridor and stairs will more comfortably allow
              two-way traffic, not to mention users with special needs. </p>

            <p>Another traffic planning feature is the location of doors and the direction the doors swing.
              Generally,
              doors should be placed toward the corner of a room to avoid cutting up the wall space, and the door
              should swing inward against the adjoining wall. Where swinging doors will be a problem, pocket doors
              or
              sliding doors that will not impede traffic may be a good choice.</p>
          </ul>

          <h3>Rethinking the Box—Planning for Flexibility</h3>
          <br>
          <h4>"Nothing is as permanent as change"</h4>
        </header>

        <p>The saying “Nothing is as permanent as change” is good to remember when summarizing space planning
          considerations. What is reality today may be just a memory tomorrow. For example, a college student
          leaving
          home for school or leaving home permanently, to return only for short visits, creates a demographic
          shift as
          well as an empty bedroom that can be reallocated for another spatial need. It may become a home office,
          a
          guest room, a hobby room. With a little remodeling, it may be absorbed to create a long-desired master
          suite
          sitting area. Planning for flexibility is the wisest sort of planning. </p>

        <p>Consider some of these potential changes in the needs of a family:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>A couple with no children can use space in any way they want and can adapt any extra bedrooms for
              their
              own personal needs.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>As children become a part of the family, spatial needs vary dramatically. Not only is the bedroom
              the
              child's world, but the entire home becomes his or her playground unless limits are placed on where
              and
              how the child can interact with his or her surroundings.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>With a growing family, play space, study space, friend-interaction space, and even
              getting-away-from-the children space become priorities.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>When students are a part of the family mix, there is increased need for computer and printer
              access.
              Many families desire to monitor use of the Internet and will opt to have computers the children use
              within sight of the daily task routine. This requires good advance space planning to meet the needs
              of
              the student as well as the adult.</p>

            <p>As the children grow up and leave home and then return for visits or to live with their own
              children, a
              need exists for both integrated and separated family living spaces. Many families will plan for an
              “apartment” where grown family members can be autonomous. This may include a kitchenette or small
              kitchen and eating area, a second laundry room, and another living space as well as bathroom and
              bedroom.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>As an increasing number of children, children-in-law, grandchildren, and all their friends come to
              visit, the family home may need to accommodate crowds. Advance planning will provide space where
              they
              can sit, visit, and eat.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Another important consideration is aging parents, who, typically between the ages of 70 and 90, can
              no
              longer live independently and need to be taken into the family home. Advance planning for a
              “mother-in-law apartment” can benefit all family members if and when the need arises. With the
              increased
              good health of the elderly making nursing home care unnecessary for many, this becomes a very real
              possibility. </p>

            <p>If the apartment is on ground level and other family members can move to another level, the
              inevitable
              stress can be reduced. Planning for a secondary master suite on another level or in another location
              in
              the house will accommodate this demand. That secondary suite would make a nice guest room when not
              occupied by a live-in family member.</p>
