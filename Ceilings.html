            <h2>Ceilings</h2>
          </header>

          <p>Ceilings are as important as any other surface in a room. Interior designers can use a number
            of materials to finish a ceiling, though, in some cases, they may wish to leave it exposed. </p>

          <p>Many ceilings are rated according to their acoustic qualities. The main unit of measure for
            acoustics is the noise reduction coefficient (NRC), a number expressed as a percentage of
            how much sound is absorbed (an NRC of 0.8 will absorb 80 percent of the sound that is directed at the
            material). </p>

          <ul>
            <p>Ceilings are literally the crowning glory of a room. For example, the great hammer-beam ceilings of
              Early
              Renaissance England—with their Tudor arch-shaped trusses supported on magnificently carved
              brackets—are
              awe-inspiring. And the delicate-patterned plaster ceilings, designed by Robert Adam in
              eighteenth-century
              England, are still beautiful examples of the importance a ceiling design can have in a room. </p>

            <p>Today, there is a vast selection of ceiling materials and types from which to choose. Ceilings may be
              decorative or structural and may even serve the important function of covering, yet pro-viding access
              to,
              mechanical systems located in the ceiling. </p>

            <p>Ceilings can provide dramatic changes in plane or space. A low, cozy fireplace nook can suddenly open
              to
              the main body of the room that soars to the rafters. Angled ceilings are interesting because of the
              variety
              of line and form they create. Ceilings can be formed in many ways. The most common types of ceilings
              are
              plain flat, vaulted, domed, coffered, coved, baffled, and suspended:</p>
          </ul>

          <br><br>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>The simplest type of ceiling is flat plaster or Sheetrock. This plain treatment is ideal when the
                intent of the design is to emphasize other areas of the room. The flat ceiling may be embellished
                with
                textured plaster, raised patterns, moldings, or medallions, which may be painted to harmonize or
                contrast with the ceiling. These embellishments are called anaglypta, which is the Greek word for
                “raised ornament.” Today, anaglypta patterns are frequently made of hardened plastic foam.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>A vault is a ceiling constructed on the principle of an arch. Therefore, a vaulted ceiling may be
                round
                (a barrel vault) or pointed like the Gothic church ceiling. In today's interiors, the tall, open,
                cathedral ceiling belongs to this group. Rooms with barrel-vaulted ceilings often have rounded ends
                with
                half-domed ceilings called niches.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Cathedral ceilings are pointed with two slopes. Those with one slope are shed ceilings. These can
                be
                exciting because of the way they open up the space, making a relatively small room feel much larger
                than
                it actually is. Cathedral and shed ceilings can also add grandeur to large spaces such as hotel
                lobbies,
                office atriums, and churches.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Tray ceilings are stepped up to become higher than the perimeter; often trimmed with moldings.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Domes are bowl-shaped, rounded ceilings. When the dome covers a drum-shaped (round) room, the space
                is
                called a rotunda. Domes may be quite flat and dish shaped or deep and high. Because its form is the
                shape of the heavens, the dome draws the eye upward and creates a feeling of expanse. In public
                spaces
                such as capitol buildings, domes create spaces of great dignity and grandeur. In a residence, a
                shallow
                recessed dome in an entry or dining room expands the visual space.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Beamed ceilings frankly expose the rafters or trusses as a decorative feature of a room. They can
                be
                very simple and rough or richly carved or painted. Beams can impart a provincial or rustic feeling
                to an
                environment. The buildings of the Southwest incorporate large pine beams called vigas as structural
                support for the smaller cross beams, called latillas, which form the ceiling. Logs add a rugged
                feeling
                to cabins and ski lodges in any geographic setting. Squared, finely finished hardwood beams trimmed
                with
                molding are favored in rich traditional interiors such as law offices, libraries, and luxury
                housing.
                Since buildings are generally no longer made of timbers, these will usually be false beams used just
                for
                effect. </p>
              <p>Metal trusses are left exposed in some of today's designs because, like their wooden counterparts
                from
                earlier times, they have interest and strength as design forms.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Coffers are boxes constructed in the recesses between beams and cross beams.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Coved ceilings are formed with a curved radius or straight angle where the wall meets the ceiling.
                This
                is accomplished by actually structuring the ceiling in that fashion or by the application of cove
                moldings. The absence of a sharp right angle has a softening effect on the room.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Dropped Ceilings </h3>

          <ul>
            <p>Dropped ceilings are also referred to as suspended ceilings. Their main function is to
              conceal items such as ductwork, piping, and wiring. The area between the dropped ceiling
              and the underside of the construction above is known as the plenum.</p>

            <p>Runners and T-splines are hung from a wire attached to the
              underside of the construction. This forms abasic grid into which tiles of various types
              are laid. Grids can be concealed within the system for a more continuous ceiling plane.</p>
          </ul>

          <h3>Hard Ceilings </h3>
          <p>For many residential and hospitality projects, designers may prefer a hard surface ceiling that
            can be painted or finished. These ceilings are installed under a wood or metal framing system
            and provide acoustic benefits through insulation in the ceiling plenum.</p>
          <ul>
            <p>Gypsum panels are the
              most commonly used, though it is not uncommon to find a layer of plaster installed over lath
              and wire mesh. The most important aspect of a ceiling is the level of finish and smoothness
              of the installation. </p>
            <p>Panels are hung, taped, covered with joint compound, and sanded smooth.
              Occasionally, a skim coat of plaster will be applied to create an even surface for the final
              application
              of paint.</p>

            <p>The six levels of finish are outlined below: </p>
            <li>
              <p>Level 0: Used in temporary construction, or in situations where the finish has not yet been
                determined. Joints are not taped and the surface is not sanded. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Level 1: Used in areas where the connections between panels are concealed; e.g. , ceiling
                plenums or fire shafts. All joints are taped with joint compound. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Level 2: Used for water resistant applications, such as in bathrooms and kitchens, especially
                where the board will receive a tile or stone surface finish. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Level 3: Used for heavy-grade finishes, such as textured sprays and commercial wall coverings. Two
                coats of joint compound are applied smoothly, and the surface is finished with a
                drywall primer. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Level 4: Used in residential and light-use construction for flat paint or other light textures. Two
                coats of compound are applied at joints and corners; all fasteners receive an additional layer.
                The surface is finished with a drywall primer. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Level 5: Used where gloss and other reflective finishes can telegraph imperfections, or where
                fasteners might be visible. Compound layers are similar to level 4, with a final skim coat applied
                over
                the entire surface. The surface is finished with a drywall primer. </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
