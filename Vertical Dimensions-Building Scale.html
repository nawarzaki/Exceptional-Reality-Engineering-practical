      <h1>Vertical Dimensions</h1>
    </header>

    <p>The pattern of horizontal spanning systems must, of
      course, be intimately related to the pattern of vertical
      supports, be they an array of columns and beams, a
      parallel series of bearing walls, or a combination of both.
      The pattern of these vertical supports should, in turn, be
      coordinated with the desired form and layout of the interior
      spaces of a building.</p>

    <p>Both columns and walls have a
      greater presence in our visual field than horizontal planes
      and are therefore more instrumental in defining a discrete
      volume of space and providing a sense of enclosure
      and privacy for those within it. In addition, they serve to
      separate one space from another and establish a common
      boundary between the interior and exterior environments.</p>

    <div id="Building_Scale">
      <header>
        <h2>Building Scale</h2>
      </header>

      <ul>
        <p>We can categorize the vertical scale of buildings into low-
          rise, mid-rise, and high-rise structures.</p>

        <li>
          <p>Low-rise structures
            generally have one, two, or three stories and no elevator; </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>mid-rise structures have a moderately large number of
            stories, usually five to ten floors, and are equipped with
            elevators;</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>high-rise structures have a comparatively
            large number of stories and must be equipped with
            elevators.</p>
        </li>

        <p>It is useful to think in these categories when
          selecting and designing a structural system because
          the scale of a building is directly related to the type of
          construction required and the uses or occupancies allowed
          by the building code.</p>
      </ul>

      <figure>
        <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/VERTICAL DIMENSIONS/Lateral forces.png" alt="VERTICAL DIMENSIONS"
          style="height: 24%; width: 36%;">
      </figure> <br><br>
      <ul>
        <p>The vertical scale of a building also influences the
          selection and design of a structural system.</p>

        <li>
          <p>For low-
            rise and short-span structures constructed of relatively
            heavy materials, such as concrete, masonry, or steel, the
            primary determinant of the structural form is typically
            the magnitude of the live load.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>For long-span structures
            constructed of similar materials, the dead load of the
            structure may be the principal factor in establishing the
            structural strategy.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>As buildings become taller, however,
            not only do gravity loads accumulate over a large number
            of stories but lateral wind and seismic forces become
            critical issues to address in the development of the overall
            structural system.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

        <h2>Human Scale</h2>
      </header>

      <p>Of a room's three dimensions, its height has a greater
        effect on its scale than either its width or length. While
        the walls of the room provide enclosure, the height of the
        ceiling plane overhead determines its qualities of shelter
        and intimacy. </p>

      <p>Raising the ceiling height of a space will be
        more noticeable and affect its scale more than increasing
        its width by a similar amount. While a modest room with
        a normal ceiling height might feel comfortable to most
        people, a large assembly space with a similar ceiling
        height would likely feel oppressive. </p>

      <p>Columns and bearing
        walls must be of sufficient height to establish the desired
        scale of a building story or a single space within the
        building. As their unsupported height increases, columns
        and bearing walls must necessarily become thicker to
        maintain their stability.</p>

      <header>
        <h2>Exterior Walls</h2>
      </header>

      <p>Walls are the vertical constructions that enclose, separate,
        and protect the interior spaces of buildings. They may
        be loadbearing structures of homogeneous or composite
        construction designed to support imposed loads from
        floors and roofs, or consist of a framework of columns
        and beams with nonstructural panels attached to or
        filling in between them. </p>

      <p>The interior walls or partitions,
        which subdivide the space within a building, may be
        either structural or nonloadbearing. Their construction
        should be able to support the desired finish materials,
        provide the required degree of acoustical separation, and
        accommodate when necessary the distribution and outlets
        of mechanical and electrical services.</p>

      <p>Openings for doors and windows must be constructed so
        that any vertical loads from above are distributed around
        the openings and not transferred to the door and window
        units themselves. Their size and location are determined
        by the requirements for natural light, ventilation, view, and
        physical access, as well as the constraints of the structural
        system and modular wall materials.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Exterior walls contribute to the visual character
            of a building, whether they have the weight and
            opacity of loadbearing walls or the lightness or the
            transparency of nonbearing curtain walls supported
            by a structural framework of columns and beams.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <header>
        <h2>Roof Structures</h2>
      </header>

      <p>The principal sheltering element of a building is its roof
        structure. It not only shields the interior spaces of a
        building from sun, rain, and snow, but it also has a major
        impact on the overall form of a building and the shaping
        of its spaces. </p>

      <p>The form and geometry of the roof structure,
        in turn, is established by the manner in which it spans
        across space to bear on its supports and slopes to shed
        rain and melting snow. As a design element, the roof plane
        is significant because of the impact it can have on the form
        and silhouette of a building within its setting.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/VERTICAL DIMENSIONS/Koshino House.png" alt="VERTICAL DIMENSIONS"
          style="height: 24%; width: 51%;">

              Tadao Ando, 1979_1984.</b></p>
        </figcaption>
      </figure> <br><br>

      <p>The roof plane can be hidden from view by the exterior
        walls of a building or merge with the walls to emphasize
        the volume of the building mass. It can be expressed as
        a single sheltering form that encompasses a variety of
        spaces beneath its canopy, or comprise a number of hats
        that articulate a series of spaces within a single building.</p>

        </figcaption>
      </figure> <br><br>

      <p>A roof plane can extend outward to form overhangs that
        shield door and window openings from sun or rain, or
        continue downward further still to relate itself more closely
        to the ground plane. In warm climates, it can be elevated
        to allow cooling breezes to flow across and through the
        interior spaces of a building.</p>
