          <h1>Wall Coverings</h1>
        </header>

        <div>
          <ul>
            <p>Wall coverings—including wallpaper, vinyl and textile wall coverings, and fabric—provide tremendous
              variety in pattern, color, texture, sound absorption, and flexibility. Walls and ceilings benefit from
              the
              many wall coverings that add visual and architectural interest. The reasons for using wall coverings
              include the following:</p>
            <li>
              <p>Colors, patterns, and textures of wall coverings are unlimited.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Wall coverings can imitate natural materials such as stone, wood, brick, or tile at a fraction of
                the
                cost of those materials.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Costs vary, but they can be modest. Installation can be done professionally or by the layperson.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Three-dimensional fabric wall coverings absorb sound and give a sense of quiet or peace to the
                interior.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Wall coverings can cover badly cracked walls or old paint; they can even camouflage architectural
                flaws
                or defects.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Fabric installed on the wall can coordinate with fabric used in other areas of the interior. Many
                wall-covering companies offer companion fabrics to match wallpapers.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Wall coverings can provide “instant decor”—they can add charm, beauty, and character to interiors.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Fabric wall coverings can be installed flat, pleated, shirred, draped, or folded, allowing
                creativity
                in the way the pattern, color, or texture is utilized.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Wall-Covering Guidelines</h3>

          <ul>
            <p>Wall coverings are so extensively used as “instant decorating” that some guidelines and cautions are
              in
              order:</p>
            <li>
              <p>Select wall coverings that are compatible with the style of furnishings and with the architecture
                of
                the building.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Formal Baroque or Renaissance designs in a modern building are not only out of character; they may
                insult the integrity of both the wall covering and the architecture. Choose pattern with great
                discrimination. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Consider how long a pattern will stay stylish and aesthetically appealing. A general rule is that
                the
                more dramatic or flamboyant the pattern, the more quickly it will become tiresome.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Limit the number of patterns in an interior and coordinate them to provide harmony from one area to
                another. Patterns that differ in style or color will be discordant, and if two or more clashing wall
                coverings are visible from any one vantage point, the effect can be disastrous.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Obvious patterns on the ceiling will visually lower the ceiling and can be psychologically
                disturbing.
                Patterns that clash with fabrics in the interior are poor choices. Keep in mind how often the
                furnishings may be changed or replaced.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Many textured and colorful wall coverings are lovely and sophisticated, and their subtle qualities
                establish pleasing transitions from one room or area to another. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>However, very intense colors, or cheap imitations (such as plastic grass cloth), may not be
                considered
                good design.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Installation is a key factor in how nice a wall covering looks. The work of professional
                wall-covering
                installers will look far superior to a careless do-it-yourself job.</p>
            </li>

                In this dining room, wainscot wall paneling is installed below a large-scale Arts
                and Crafts patterned wallcovering. The adjoining room behind has a small-scale
                wallcovering, and the entry to the library as well as walls next to the stairway
                are painted.</figcaption>

            <h3>Wall-Covering Terms</h3>
          </header>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Single rolls contain 2.75 to 3.30 square metre, being about 8.50 metre long by 0.65 metre wide.
                When
                calculating
                wall-covering quantity, figure that single roll will cover 2.30 to 2.75 square metre, which allows
                for
                waste.
                European papers have 2.6 square metre per single roll. Wallpapers are priced as single rolls and may
                be
                purchased
                by the single roll (abbreviated S/R).</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Double roll is the equivalent of, and is priced as, two single rolls rolled into one—it usually
                contains about 6.60 square metre. It saves waste and is therefore more economical.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Triple roll is priced as and equals three single rolls in one length, about 10.00 square metre. The
                most economical use of the paper.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Dye lot is a single run of colors or a single production. The dye-lot shades may vary. If it
                becomes
                necessary to reorder, always specify the dye-lot number (included on a piece of paper with the roll)
                or
                send in a swatch of the paper. It is not always possible to obtain the same dye lot at a later date,
                so
                do not skimp when ordering.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Border is a narrow or wide band of wallpaper used to trim and accent. Borders are usually packaged
                in
                single “spools” of 4.50 metre.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Pattern repeat comes in two directions. A vertical pattern repeat is the complete motif or pattern
                from
                the top of one length to the top of the next. A large pattern repeat is more wasteful, since a
                complete
                pattern repeat must begin at the top of each length. </p>
              <p>A horizontal pattern repeat means that the pattern can be matched straight across or drop-matched
                by
                lowering the next length of paper.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Peelable wall covering means the top layer of the wallpaper will peel off, leaving a substrate
                (lining)
                material that can be papered over again.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Prepasted wall covering means the paper has a dry coating of paste and will need only to be
                moistened
                to be applied.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Pretrimmed wall covering means ready to hang. Hand-printed wallpapers have a selvage (border) with
                separate printed information, including blocks of color used in the paper. This must be trimmed off
                before the paper is hung. Pretrimmed papers have the selvage cut off. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Semitrimmed has only one side of the selvage trimmed, so the selvage left on is under an overlap or
                is
                trimmed off at the site.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Scrubbable denotes a wall covering that can withstand repeated wet cleaning. Most vinyl wall
                coverings
                are scrubbable.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Sizing is a thin liquid painted onto the wall surface that reduces the amount of paste absorbed by
                the
                wallpaper. It also gives the surface “tooth,” or enough abrasiveness to stick well, and it seals the
                surface so that alkali cannot penetrate into the wallpaper</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Strippable is a term applied to papers that can be stripped off the wall completely without
                scraping or
                steaming.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Washable means the paper can be cleaned gently with a little soap and water.</p>
            </li>

            <h3>Methods of Installing Wall Fabric</h3>
          </header>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Covered-frame method uses a lath frame (1-inch by 2-inch wooden strips) laid on the back of the
                fabric.
                The fabric is pulled tightly over the frame and stapled. The result is a blind wooden frame with top
                and
                sides covered with fabric. This can be mounted or hung on protruding nails as panels and may not
                cover
                the entire wall. Smaller fabric-framed panels may be accessory items.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Direct paste-up uses fabrics that come prepared for installation as a wall covering with a paper or
                foam backing, or the installer may apply a spray backing or iron on a stiffening fabric backing.
                Sometimes the preparation or paste causes the fabric grain to slip, making it difficult to match
                patterns horizontally. A skilled professional is an asset in direct fabric paste-up.</p>

              <p>A less permanent method is to sponge liquid laundry starch onto the wall or dip the fabric in it.
                The
                fabric will stick to the wall until it is remoistened and pulled off.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Hook-and-loop fasteners may be used to install fabric in cases where the fabric needs to be taken
                down
                frequently for cleaning. The best-known brand of hook-and-loop fasteners is Velcro. One half of the
                tape
                is sewn or glued to the fabric and the companion part is applied to the wall.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Lath method uses wood lath strips nailed to the wall perimeter. The fabric is stapled, glued, or
                fastened to the strips with hook-and-loop tape. This saves the effort of preparing badly damaged
                walls
                or stiffening the fabric for direct paste-up.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Panel-track method can use several brands of metal or plastic tracks that are on the market for the
                professional, usually contract installation of fabric on the wall. These include office systems
                furniture, which provides a flexible wall where fabrics can be changed when necessary.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Stapling with a staple gun is a fast, easy method of applying fabric to the wall. The staples may
                be
                covered with trim such as welt or gimp or braid or with wood or plastic molding.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Strapping-tape method is a very inexpensive and easy method. Simply roll lengths of strapping tape
                into
                circles and flatten against the wall; then press the fabric in place. High humidity or certain paint
                surfaces may make this method unsatisfactory, however.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Upholstered walls mean that there is a layer of batting applied first to the wall in the form of
                polyester or cotton batting or foam. The fabric is then stapled over the padding, and a trim is
                placed
                on top. This gives extra sound-absorption and insulation values.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Coordinating or companion fabrics are available with some wall coverings. This is a convenient,
                although not inexpensive, way to coordinate fabric installations with wall coverings.</p>

            <li>
              <p>cork wall coverings use cork, a natural resilient bark, cut into very thin layers with a paper
                backing.

              <p>Fabric or textile wall coverings are fabrics laminated to a paper backing and sold in rolls or
                bolts.
                The most common fabric wall coverings are linen, jute, and wool. They give a rich natural-textured
                look
                and are very appropriate for both residential and contract interiors.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Fabric-backed wall coverings are used for heavy-face papers or vinyl to give strength to the

            <h3>Fabric-Covered Walls</h3>
          </header>

          <ul>
            <p>Fabric installed or upholstered onto a wall or ceiling has many advantages. It is the most flexible
              wall
              covering, as it can be applied flat, gathered (shirred), pleated, or folded. Fabrics can change their
              character with the different methods of installation. </p>

            <p>A patterned fabric laid flat looks quite different from one that is shirred, pleated, or folded.
              Installations can be quite temporary, permanent, or semi-permanent. Fabrics provide these additional
              benefits:</p>

            <li>
              <p>Insulation against both noise and temperature extremes</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Visual comfort as well as physical softness</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The ability to use the same material on other installations, such as upholstered furniture,
                bedspreads,
                and accessory items Fabrics used on the wall may be subject to soiling and may discolor or stain
                when
                spot cleaned, making upkeep difficult. Fabrics should not be used in heavy traffic areas where
                people,
                particularly children, tend to touch the wall frequently.</p>

            <h3>Ceiling Treatments</h3>
          </header>

          <p>While most of the materials discussed for wall treatments may also be applied to ceilings, the most
            typical
            ceiling materials are those that are lighter in weight, such as acoustical tile, wallboard, plaster,
            wood,
            and cork. </p>

          <p>Most guidelines for the use of paint and wall coverings on walls will also hold true for ceiling
            treatments. The ceiling treatment can have a powerful, yet subtle, influence on the overall feeling of
            space
            in the interior. </p>

          <p>For ceilings that need to be visually lowered, use patterns, dark or bright colors, or texture. To
            visually
            raise the height, use smooth surfaces and light, pale, or dull colors. </p>

          <p>Horizontal beams or bands will visually lower a ceiling, whereas angled ceilings with beams that carry
            the
            eye upward—an effect often seen in church interiors—will increase the visual height. Fabric is sometimes
            draped on a ceiling in sunburst or tentlike fashion to create a cozy atmosphere.</p>

          <p>In interiors where sound needs to be absorbed, fabric is a good choice. It can be upholstered onto the
            ceiling as well as draped, and it is also available in fabric panels and acoustical panels. Acoustical
            tile,
            of course, is also a good sound absorber, as is textured acoustical plaster. </p>

            <h3>Window Treatments</h3>
          </header>

          <p>Because of consumer demands for beauty, privacy, energy conservation, comfort, and cost efficiency,
            today's
            window treatments offer a variety of options that continually expands with advancing technology.</p>

          <ul>
            <p>Window treatments are generally divided into two categories—soft and alternative. </p>

            <li>
              <p>Soft window treatments include draperies, curtains, fabric shades, and top treatments; </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>alternative coverings include a wide array of art glass, horizontal and vertical slat blinds,
                screens,
                shades, and shutters</p>
            </li>

            <p>Recent trends have favored layered treatments—two or more fabric treatments, or a practical and
              durable
              alternative treatment (a blind, shutter, screen, or shade) layered with a soft fabric treatment of
              curtain, drapery, or top treatment.</p>
          </ul>

          <h3>Window-Treatment Considerations</h3>

          <p>Many factors go into making a wise choice for a window covering. These include aesthetic coordination,
            privacy, energy consciousness, light control, and also operational control. </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Aesthetic Coordination</h4>

              <p>Aesthetic coordination is the careful selection of window treatments not only to look beautiful but
                also to blend with and support the interior and exterior design and architecture.</p>

              <p>Aesthetic coordination also requires sensitivity to good proportion. It helps to judge proportion
                by
                sketching the window treatment to scale. Window treatments that are top heavy, too wide,
                overdone—or, on
                the other hand, too skimpy—can throw off the proportions of the entire room. This is because the
                window
                itself is an important architectural feature that will inevitably draw attention because of the
                light
                and view.</p>

              <p> If the window treatment is aesthetically disturbing, the interior will seem incomplete and lacking
                in
                harmony, no matter how handsome other furnishings are.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Privacy</h4>

              <p>Privacy protects valuable belongings against burglary. Privacy also gives a psychological sense of
                well-being and makes a space more usable after dark.</p>

              <p>During the day, adequate privacy can be obtained with translucent treatments, which also offer the
                advantage of allowing daylight into the interior. Sheer and semi sheer curtains, pleated fabric
                shades,
                louvered blinds or shutters, and pierced screens all give good daytime privacy.</p>

              <p>Translucent treatments do not give nighttime privacy. Alternative treatments that have holes or
                slats
                that do not close completely do not provide total privacy either. Only opaque treatments that can be
                closed fully provide complete nighttime privacy. These include opaque draperies and shades, solid
                vane
                vertical louvers, opaque cellular pleated shades, and rout less (no holes) horizontal blinds.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Energy Consciousness</h4>

              <p>Energy consciousness is important for two reasons:</p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>The cost of heating or cooling a room is reduced through energy-efficient treatments.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>The comfort of the room is enhanced by controlling excess heat gain and heat loss. Heat gain or
                    solar heat gain can be a problem not only in hot climates and in the summer but anytime heat
                    from
                    the sun becomes uncomfortable and begins to fade or damage interior furnishings. Treatments that
                    control heat gain are referred to as shading devices. The ideal shading device is actually on
                    the
                    exterior, preventing the sun from hitting the glass of the window. Glare and UV control can be
                    achieved through window film and through shading window devices. </p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Glare is excessive luminance, often from large window expanses, that causes fatigue and irritation.
                Natural light also contains ultraviolet (UV) light, which permanently damages furniture by fading
                art
                and accessories, fabric applications, carpets and rugs, and wood flooring. UV light also dries out
                wood
                floors and furnishings, causing them to split or crack. </p>

              <p>Window film can eliminate glare and over 99 percent of the UV light. Sheer fabric draperies and
                curtains and alternative window treatments such as shadings and pleated shades can also do this.
              </p>

              <p>Glare can also be decreased in slatted treatments—shutters and horizontal and vertical blinds. UV
                protection can also be achieved by operating blinds and shutters to keep furnishings in the shade of
                the
                treatment. This method, however, requires vigilance and perhaps a schedule whereby the louvers are
                adjusted to a particular angle. By coupling window film with shading devices, protection against
                glare
                and unwanted UV light is assured.</p>

              <p>Once the sun hits the glass, temperatures between the window and the interior window treatment can
                climb to as high as 300 degrees Fahrenheit, heating the room and causing damage to furnishings. The
                most
                effective interior shading devices are those that can reflect a high percentage of sunlight back
                through
                the glass. Window film and metallized pleated shades and light-colored treatments do this best. </p>

              <p>Room-darkening treatments also effectively control heat and brightness. Heat loss is a problem in
                moderate to cold climates in the winter. When heated interior air rises and travels toward the
                window,
                it comes in contact with cold glass, cooling the heated air, which then drops to the floor and
                circulates at ankle level, where we may feel a draft. Preventing the warm air from striking the
                glass is
                the best preventative for heat loss. Insulated fabric shades sealed on the sides and at the bottom
                and
                insulated shutters are the best treatments. </p>

              <p>Other good choices are opaque roller shades and heavy lined/interlined draperies that reach to the
                floor, are securely attached to the walls, and have sealed top treatments. The heavier and more
                solid
                the treatment, the better it insulates.</p>

              <figure>

                  style="height: 50%; width: 50%;">
              </figure>

            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Light Control</h4>

              <p>Control of light is a major consideration in selecting window treatments. Light-controlling needs
                should be noted in the design program. If the room needs to be completely darkened, certain opaque
                treatments will fill that requirement. </p>

              <p>Light is often desirable, although glare (intense directional light) causes irritation and fatigue.
                Many treatments do a good job of controlling glare: draperies, curtains, shades (of light to medium
                weight), all types of vertical and horizontal blinds, pleated and translucent shades, louvered
                shutters,
                screens, and bamboo shades.</p>

              <p>Within an interior, the need for light and glare control may vary according to the orientation, or
                direction, the windows face. Whereas north-facing windows may need little light control, the bright
                east
                light, constant south light, or hot, piercing west light may require shading devices during
                particular
                times of the day when the sunlight comes directly through windows facing those directions.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Operational Control</h4>

              <p>The selection of a window treatment should also be based on whether or not it needs to be operable,
                and
                this will largely be dictated by the needs previously discussed. Stationary treatments—tied-back
                draperies, ruffled curtains, top treatments, stationary screens—cannot be closed for privacy, nor
                can
                they be removed for desirable solar gain or maximum light penetration. Ventilation may be inhibited
                by a
                treatment that is difficult to operate or that will not adequately stack out of the window area.</p>

              <p>For many treatments on cord- or pulley-operated hard-ware, motorized units can operate the opening
                and
                closing of the treatment. Many situations can benefit from motorized units—from hard-to-reach
                controls
                (such as solarium shades) to control by a disabled person to the convenience of automation or remote
                control. </p>

              <p>There are also mechanisms that can sense, by light or temperature change, when to close treatments,
                thus enhancing energy efficiency.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Soft Window Coverings</h4>

              <p>Fabric at the window gives softness to an inherently hard and poorly insulative material. Fabric
                provides sound and temperature insulation, visual comfort, and interest through color, texture, and
                perhaps pattern. In addition, light-filtering fabrics can give daytime privacy (and be layered with
                opaque fabrics or hard materials for night-time privacy) and can effectively reduce or eliminate
                glare.
              </p>

              <p>Fabrics can be installed on traverse rods to be drawn off the window. Fabrics also can be made into
                many decorative shapes, giving architectural support, authenticity, or decorative effects. There
                seems
                to be no limit to the styles and combinations of fabrics used at the window, making the window
                perhaps
                the most creative of all background material installations. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Draperies</h4>

              <p>Draperies are pleated fabric panels hung on a rod. Draperies may be opaque, casement (semi-opaque),
                or
                translucent. There are many types of pleats, the most common being the French or pinch pleat. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Curtains</h4>

              <p>Curtains are often shirred, or gathered, onto a rod, making them stationary or hand operable.
                Shirred
                curtains may be formal or informal. Curtains can also have a variety of headings depending on the
                use.
              </p>

              <p>Some types of curtains. Fabric Window Shades Fabric shades are panels of fabric that operate top to
                bot-tom. In Great Britain they are called blinds. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Top Treatments</h4>

              <p>Top treatments are used for a number of reasons: to hide rods or pleats, to cover the area from the
                top
                of the window to the ceiling, to give a soft and finished look to the room. </p>

              <p>Top treatments may be shaped according to architectural detailing or may be inspired by
                furnishings.
                They are often an effective medium to unite a room and carry the eye gracefully along the top of the
                walls.</p>

              <h4>Drapery Hardware</h4>
              <p>Much of the versatility possible in soft window coverings is due to the many kinds of hardware that
                have been developed, Many variations of each type are available through interior designers and
                window-treatment specialists.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Alternative Window Treatments</h4>
              <p>Alternative materials are generally very durable and require little maintenance. They can be clean
                and
                contemporary or very traditional, crossing boundaries in many cases. They serve as versatile
                backgrounds
                and are often simple statements that will coordinate with many styles of furnishings. Some are
                moderately priced and offer both privacy and light control.

                within the window frame and offer ﬂexibility in being raised from the top or
                bottom, assuring light control, privacy,
                and energy efﬁciency. Horizontal lines arehandsome from both inside and outside.The custom-designed

            <h4>Calculating Yardage for Window Treatments</h4>
            <p>For Curtains and Draperies</p>
            <li>
              <p>Determine rod width (end of rod to end of rod).</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Add on for overlaps (for traverse draperies that meet in the center) and returns (around the corner
                to
                the wall), if applicable. A measure of 30 cm is standard for a single-hung layer, 40 cm for a
                double-hung layer, and 10 cm for an under layer.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Divide by 50 cm to determine the number of widths or cuts (a typical 110 cm- to 120 cm fabric will
                pleat or gather down to about 50 cm including side hems).</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Determine the desired finished length (add 15 cm for puddling if desired); then add for hems,
                headings, and any ruffles to determine the cut length. Hems are usually 10 cm doubled, or 20 cm.
                For pleated headings add 20 cm. Ruffled headings will need 15 to 30 cm added depending on the
                depth of the ruffle and the width of the rod. (Figure the finished length plus the rod pocket, the
                ruffle, and another 5 cm for the self-lining and hem, which is turned under.)</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Multiply the cut length by the number of widths or cuts to find the total inches; then divide by 90
                cm
                to yield the number of yards. Always round up. For pattern repeats, figure the number of complete
                pattern repeats needed for each cut; then multiply that number by the inches in one pattern; repeat
                for
                the total inches needed per cut. There will be waste in pattern-repeat fabrics because the pattern
                must
                start at the same point at the top of each cut. Yardage will be an average of 20 percent greater.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Costs for sewing, installation (charged by the width), and the rods are additional.</p>
            </li>

            <li>

              <ul>
                <h4> For Balloon
                  Shades</h4>

                <li>
                  <p>Determine finished width; then divide by 50 cm for the number of cuts or widths.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Add 15 to 20 cm for hems and headings; then add 50 cm for the pouf at the bottom.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Ruffle yardage is figured in widthwise or lengthwise strips. Total centimetre of ruffle needed
                    will
                    be
                    multiplied by 2 or 3 (for desired full-ness), and the depth of the ruffle doubled plus 2.5 cm
                    for
                    self-lining. These dimensions are calculated or sketched out in scale into the width of the
                    goods
                    either widthwise or lengthwise.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Cost to sew is figured per square centimetre (ruffles are extra, charged per linear
                    centimetre),
                    and
                    fabrication costs are greater if the shade is operable.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Installation board and cost to install are priced per linear centimetre. Board may be included
                    in
                    cost of
                    shade fabrication.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>

            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>For Flat, Shaped, and Pleated Valances</h3>
          <ol>

            <li>
              <p>Determine whether the width should run vertically in cuts or horizontally (railroaded) with no
                seams.
                Railroaded fabric may appear a different color than the curtain or shade beneath it because of the
                way
                the light hits the weave.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Determine the cuts or widths (if selected) as previously determined for curtains, eliminating the
                overlap but figuring in returns. Multiply the cuts by doubling the finished length for self-lining,
                plus
                2 to 4 inches for seams, or multiply by the finished length plus 2 to 4 inches if lining fabric is
                used.
                Divide by 36 inches for yardage; then round up. Order the same quantity of lining fabric if the
                fabric
                is not to be self-lined.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Railroaded valances and curtains/draperies turn the width to run the lengthwise direction of the
                goods.
                Multiply the finished width by 2½ (or fullness desired) and divide by 36 inches for yardage. For
                valances, figure strips this way—finished length—face only or self-lined measurement divided into
                the
                width of the goods.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>


          <ol>
            <h3>For Swags and Cascades</h3>

            <li>
              <p>Determine the number of swags or festoons by sketching them in the configuration desired and
                determining the overlap and width of each swag. Measure for desired depth.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>A self-lined swag up to 50 cm wide and 30 cm deep will need 90 cm to 500 cm each; a self-lined
                swag up to 100 cm wide and 60 cm deep will need 270 cm each.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Cascades and jabots need metre equal to double their finished length. Costs to sew are determined
                by
                the workroom. Sewing on ruffles or trimmings will cost extra (trimming metre is 9.60 times the top
                of
                the swag); installation is per swag or cascade or per linear foot of installation board.</p>
            </li>

          </ol>
