          <h2>Code and Accessibility </h2>
        </header>

        <div>
          <p>The building code is specified by
            the jurisdiction in which a project will be built. These codes can be defined by a
            state, county, township, or city and are typically based on a national model such as
            BOCA, IBC, and UBC. </p>

          <p>The main focus of these codes is to secure the public's life
            safety. Codes are frequently amended, and designers need to know which edition
            the jurisdiction is adhering to during the permitting timeframe of a specific project.</p>

          <p>ADA was passed in 1990 to secure civil rights protections for people with disabilities. Unlike the building
            code, ADA includes design guidelines and requirements
            based on the principle of equality for people with disabilities.</p>

          <p>Compliance with the
            building code thus does not mean compliance with ADA, and vice versa. ADA is
            the national accessibility code, and as with the building code, jurisdictions have
            interpretations of the guidelines that are specific to the governing municipality. It is
            reasonable to assume that these guidelines are written for public facilities and not
            for private use. </p>

          The terminology of the building code and accessibility guidelines are not always the
          same. While interpreting a code or guideline, it is important to reference the correct
          definitions.

          <h4>Clear Opening</h4>
          <p>The minimum clear opening width is 32 inches (813 millimeters) measured with the door open
            in a 90-degree position. The measurement should be taken from the face of the door to the
            stop on the strike jamb. For bifold, accordion, and pocket doors, the clear widths are measured when the
            doors are in a fully opened position. No projections are allowed in clear opening space, with
            the exception of door hardware.</p>

          <p>For double doors, one leaf must comply with the minimum clear opening. Shallow closets
            that are less than 24 inches (610 millimeters) deep are exempt from the minimum clear width.
            Doors that are recessed more than 6 inches (152 millimeters) from the door opening need to
            comply with pull- or push-side requirements.</p>

              <h4>Thresholds</h4>
              <p>The maximum height for a threshold
                is a half inch with a slope no greater
                than 1:2. Half-inch (12.7-millimeter) pile
                carpet is the maximum allowed. </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>Door Hardware </h4>
              <p>Handles, pulls, latches, and locks must be easy to grasp with one hand. Door hardware should
                be operable with a closed fist or loose grip. All operating devices should be mounted between
                34 and 48 inches (864-1 220 millimeters) above finished floor.</p> <br>

              <h4>Opening Force </h4>
              <p>The opening force for an interior hinged,
                sliding, or folding door should not exceed 5 pounds (2.26 kilograms). The opening force
                does not consider the force required to operate a latch or the initial force to open the
                door; it is a measure, rather, of the continuous application of force. </p> <br>
