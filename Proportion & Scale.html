        <h3>MATERIAL PROPORTIONS</h3>

        <p>All building materials in architecture have distinct
          properties of elasticity, hardness, and durability. And
          they all have an ultimate strength beyond which they
          cannot extend themselves without fracturing, breaking,
          or collapsing. Since the stresses in a material resulting
          from the force of gravity increase with size, all materials
          also have rational dimensions beyond which they cannot
          go.</p>

        <p>For example, a stone slab that is 4 inches thick and
          8 feet long can be reasonably expected to support itself
          as a bridge between two supports. But if its size were to
          increase fourfold, to 16 inches thick and 32 feet long,
          it would probably collapse under its own weight. Even a
          strong material like steel has lengths beyond which it
          cannot span without exceeding its ultimate strength.</p>

        <p>All materials also have rational proportions that are
          dictated by their inherent strengths and weaknesses.
          Masonry units like brick, for example, are strong in
          compression and depend on their mass for strength. Such
          materials are therefore volumetric in form. Materials like
          steel are strong in both compression and tension and can
          therefore be formed into linear columns and beams as well
          as planar sheet materials. Wood, being a flexible and fairly
          elastic material, can be used as linear posts and beams,
          planar boards, and as a volumetric element in log cabin
          construction.</p> <br>

        <h3>STRUCTURAL PROPORTIONS</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/form space and order/Proportion and Scale/Naigu, Ise Inner Shrine.png"
            alt="Proportion and Scale" style="height: 24%; width: 30%;">
          <figcaption>
            <p><b>South gateway of the third fence of Naigu, Ise Inner Shrine,
                Mie Prefecture, Japan, A.D. 690</b></p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>In the construction of architecture, structural elements are called
          upon to span spaces and transmit their loads through vertical
          supports to the foundation system of a building. The size and
          proportion of these elements are directly related to the structural
          tasks they perform and can therefore be visual indicators of the size
          and scale of the spaces they help enclose.</p>

        <p>Beams, for example, transmit their loads horizontally across space
          to their vertical supports. If the span or load of a beam were doubled,
          its bending stresses would likewise double, possibly causing it to
          collapse. But if its depth were doubled, its strength would increase
          fourfold. Depth, therefore, is the critical dimension of a beam and its
          depth-to-span ratio can be a useful indicator of its structural role.</p>

        <p>In a similar manner, columns become thicker as their loads and
          unsupported height increase. Together, beams and columns form a
          skeletal structural framework that defines modules of space. By their
          size and proportion, columns and beams articulate space and give it
          scale and a hierarchical structure. This can be seen in the way joists
          are supported by beams, which in turn are supported by girders. Each
          element increases in depth as its load and span increase in size.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/form space and order/Proportion and Scale/STRUCTURAL PROPORTIONS 1.jpg"
            alt="Proportion and Scale" style="height: 24%; width: 48%;">
          <figcaption>
            <p><b>STRUCTURAL PROPORTIONS</b></p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>The proportions of other structural elements, such as
          bearing walls, floor and roof slabs, vaults, and domes, also
          give us visual clues to their role in a structural system as
          well as the nature of their material. A masonry wall, being
          strong in compression but relatively weak in bending, will be
          thicker than a reinforced concrete wall doing the same work.
          A steel column will be thinner than a wood post supporting
          the same load. A 4 inch-thick reinforced concrete slab will
          span farther than 4 inch wood decking.</p>

        <p>As a structure depends less on the weight and stiffness
          of a material and more on its geometry for stability, as in
          the case of a membrane structure or a space frame, its
          elements will get thinner and thinner until they lose their
          ability to give a space scale and dimension.</p>

      <div id="MANUFACTURED_PROPORTIONS">

        <h3>MANUFACTURED PROPORTIONS</h3>

        <p>Many architectural elements are sized and proportioned
          not only according to their structural properties
          and function, but also by the process through which
          they are manufactured. Because these elements are
          mass-produced in factories, they have standard sizes
          and proportions imposed on them by the individual
          manufacturers or by industry standards.</p>

        <p>Concrete block and common brick, for example, are
          produced as modular building units. Although they differ
          from each other in size, both are proportioned on a similar
          basis. Plywood and other sheathing materials also are
          manufactured as modular units with fixed proportions.
          Steel sections have fixed proportions generally agreed
          upon by the steel manufacturers and the American
          Institute of Steel Construction. Windows and doors have
          proportions that are set by the individual manufacturers
          of the units.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/form space and order/Proportion and Scale/Standard Casement Window Units.png"
            alt="Proportion and Scale" style="height: 24%; width: 45%;">
          <img src="images/form space and order/Proportion and Scale/MANUFACTURED PROPORTIONS.png"

          <figcaption>
            <p><b>MANUFACTURED PROPORTIONS</b></p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>Since these and other materials must ultimately come
          together and achieve a high degree of fit in the construction of a building, the standard sizes and
          proportions of
          factory-produced elements affect the size, proportion,
          and spacing of other materials as well. Standard door
          and window units are sized and proportioned to fit into
          modular masonry openings. Wood or metal studs and
          joists are spaced to accept modular sheathing materials.</p>

        <p>Even considering the proportional constraints imposed on a
          form by the nature of its material, its structural function, or
          by the manufacturing process, the designer still has the ability to control the proportion of the forms and
          spaces within
          and around a building. The decision to make a room square or
          oblong in plan, intimate or lofty in scale, or to endow a building with an imposing, higher-than-usual facade,
          legitimately
          falls to the designer. But on what basis are these decisions
          made?.</p>

        <p>If a space 400 square feet in area were required, what
          dimensions—what ratios of width-to-length and length-to-
          height—should it have? Of course, the functioning of the
          space and the nature of the activities to be accommodated
          will influence its form and proportion.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/form space and order/Proportion and Scale/space proportion.png" alt="Proportion and Scale"
            style="height: 24%; width: 45%;">
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>A square space, having four equal faces, is static in nature. If its length expands and
          dominates its width, it becomes more dynamic. While square and oblong spaces define places
          for activity, linear spaces encourage movement and are susceptible to subdivision into a
          number of zones.</p> <br><br>

        <h3>PROPORTIONING SYSTEMS</h3>

        <p>In truth, our perception of the physical dimensions of
          architecture, of proportion and scale, is imprecise. It is
          distorted by the foreshortening of perspective and distance,
          and by cultural biases, and is thus difficult to control and
          predict in an objective and precise manner.</p>

        <p>Small or slight differences in the dimensions of a form are
          especially difficult to discern. While a square, by definition,
          has four equal sides and four right angles, a rectangle can
          appear to be exactly square, almost a square, or very much
          unlike a square. It can appear to be long, short, stubby, or
          squat, depending on our point of view. We use these terms to
          give a form or figure a visual quality that is largely a result of
          how we perceive its proportions. It is not, however, an exact
          science.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/form space and order/Proportion and Scale/PROPORTIONING SYSTEMS.png"

        <p>If the precise dimensions and relationships of a design
          that is regulated by a proportioning system cannot be
          objectively perceived in a similar manner by everyone, why are
          proportioning systems useful and of particular significance
          in architectural design?</p>

        <p>The intent of all theories of proportions is to create a
          sense of order and harmony among the elements in a
          visual construction. According to Euclid, a ratio refers to
          the quantitative comparison of two similar things, while
          proportion refers to the equality of ratios. Underlying any
          proportioning system, therefore, is a characteristic ratio,
          a permanent quality that is transmitted from one ratio
          to another. Thus, a proportioning system establishes a
          consistent set of visual relationships between the parts
          of a building, as well as between the parts and the whole. </p>

        <p>Although these relationships may not be immediately
          perceived by the casual observer, the visual order they create
          can be sensed, accepted, or even recognized through a series
          of repetitive experiences. Over a period of time, we might
          begin to see the whole in the part, and the part in the whole.</p>

          <h2>Theories of Proportion</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Proportioning systems go beyond the functional and technical
          determinants of architectural form and space to provide an
          aesthetic rationale for their dimensions. They can visually unify
          the multiplicity of elements in an architectural design by having
          all of its parts belong to the same family of proportions. They
          can provide a sense of order in, and heighten the continuity of, a
          sequence of spaces. They can establish relationships between the
          exterior and interior elements of a building.</p>

        <p>A number of theories of "desirable" proportions have been developed
          in the course of history. The notion of devising a system for design
          and communicating its means is common to all periods. Although
          the actual system varies from time to time, the principles involved
          and their value to the designer remain the same.</p>

          <h2>GOLDEN SECTION</h2>
        </header>

        <p>Mathematical systems of proportion originate from the Pythagorean
          concept of "all is number" and the belief that certain numerical
          relationships manifest the harmonic structure of the universe. One
          of these relationships that has been in use ever since the days of
          antiquity is the proportion known as the Golden Section.</p>

        <p>The Greeks
          recognized the dominating role the Golden Section played in the
          proportions of the human body. Believing that both humanity and the
          shrines housing their deities should belong to a higher universal order,
          they utilized these same proportions in their temple structures.
          Renaissance architects also explored the Golden Section in their
          work. In more recent times, Le Corbusier based his Modulor system on
          the Golden Section. Its use in architecture endures even today.</p>

        <p>The Golden Section can be defined as the ratio between two sections
          of a line, or the two dimensions of a plane figure, in which the lesser of
          the two is to the greater as the greater is to the sum of both. It can
          be expressed algebraically by the equation of two ratios:</p>

        <p>The Golden Section has some remarkable algebraic and geometric
          properties that account for its existence in architecture as well as in
          the structures of many living organisms. Any progression based on
          the Golden Section is at once additive and geometrical.</p>

        <p> Another progression that closely approximates the Golden Section
          in whole numbers is the Fibonacci Series: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8....
          Each term again is the sum of the two preceding ones, and the ratio
          between two consecutive terms tends to approximate the Golden
          Section as the series progresses to infinity.</p>

        <p>In the numerical progression: 1, Ø 1, Ø 2, Ø 3… Ø n, each term is the
          sum of the two preceding ones.</p>

        <p>A rectangle whose sides are proportioned according to
          the Golden Section is known as a Golden Rectangle. If a
          square is constructed on its smaller side, the remaining
          portion of the original rectangle would be a smaller but
          similar Golden Rectangle. This operation can be repeated
          indefinitely to create a gradation of squares and Golden
          Rectangles. During this transformation, each part remains
          similar to all of the other parts, as well as to the whole.
          The diagrams on this page illustrate this additive and
          geometrical growth pattern of progressions based on the
          Golden Section.</p>

          <p>If the diagonals of two rectangles are either parallel or perpendicular to each
            other, they indicate that the two rectangles have similar proportions. These
            diagonals, as well as lines that indicate the common alignment of elements,
            are called regulating lines. They were seen previously in the discussion of
            the Golden Section, but they can also be used to control the proportion and
            placement of elements in other proportioning systems as well. Le Corbusier, in
            Towards a New Architecture, stated the following:</p>

          <p>"A regulating line is an assurance against capriciousness; it is a means of
            verification which can ratify all work created in fervour…. It confers on the
            work the quality of rhythm. The regulating line brings in this tangible form of
            mathematics which gives the reassuring perception of order. The choice of a
            regulating line fixes the fundamental geometry of the work…. It is a means
            to an end; it is not a recipe."</p>

            structural grid of a villa by Le Corbusier. While both
            villas shared a similar proportioning system and a
            relationship to a higher mathematical order, Palladio's
            villa consisted of spaces with fixed shapes and
            harmonic interrelationships. Le Corbusier's villa was
            composed of horizontal layers of free space defined by
            the floor and roof slabs. The rooms varied in shape and
            were asymmetrically arranged at each level.</p>

          <h2>CLASSICAL ORDERS</h2>
        </header>

        <p>To the Greeks and Romans of classical antiquity, the Orders represented
          in their proportioning of elements the perfect expression of beauty and
          harmony. The basic unit of dimension was the diameter of the column. From
          this module were derived the dimensions of the shaft, the capital, as well as
          the pedestal below and the entablature above, down to the smallest detail.
          Intercolumniation—the system of spacing between columns—was also
          based on the diameter of the column.</p>

        <p>Because the sizes of columns varied according to the extent of a building,
          the Orders were not based on a fixed unit of measurement. Rather, the
          intention was to ensure that all of the parts of any one building were
          proportionate and in harmony with one another.</p>

        <p>Vitruvius, in the time of Augustus, studied actual examples of the Orders
          and presented his "ideal" proportions for each in his treatise, The Ten Books
          on Architecture. Vignola recodified these rules for the Italian Renaissance
          and his forms for the Orders are probably the best known today.</p>

          <h2>RENAISSANCE THEORIES</h2>
        </header>

        <p>Pythagoras discovered that the consonances of the
          Greek musical system could be expressed by the
          simple numerical progression—1, 2, 3, 4—and
          their ratios, 1:2, 1:3, 2:3, 3:4. This relationship led
          the Greeks to believe they had found the key to the
          mysterious harmony that pervaded the universe.
          The Pythagorean creed was “Everything is arranged
          according to numbers.” Plato later developed
          Pythagoras' aesthetics of numbers into an aesthetics
          of proportion. He squared and cubed the simple
          numerical progression to produce the double and triple
          progressions, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 1, 3, 9, 27. For Plato,
          these numbers and their ratios not only contained
          the consonances of the Greek musical scale but also
          expressed the harmonic structure of his universe.</p>

        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>The architects of the Renaissance, believing that their
          buildings had to belong to a higher order, returned
          to the Greek mathematical system of proportions.
          Just as the Greeks conceived music to be geometry
          translated into sound, Renaissance architects believed
          that architecture was mathematics translated into
          spatial units. Applying Pythagoras' theory of means
          to the ratios of the intervals of the Greek musical
          scale, they developed an unbroken progression of
          ratios that formed the basis for the proportions of
          their architecture. These series of ratios manifested
          themselves not only in the dimensions of a room or a
          facade, but also in the interlocking proportions of a
          sequence of spaces or an entire plan.</p>

            <p><b>Seven Ideal Plan Shapes for Rooms.
                Andrea Palladio (1508_1580) was probably the most influential
                architect of the Italian Renaissance. In The Four Books on Architecture,
                first published in Venice in 1570, he followed in the footsteps of his
                predecessors, Alberti and Serlio, and proposed these seven "most
                beautiful and proportionable manners of rooms."</b></p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>Determining the Heights of Rooms.
          Palladio also proposed several methods for determining the height
          of a room so that it would be in proper proportion to the room's
          width and length. The height of rooms with flat ceilings would
          be equal to their width. The height of square rooms with vaulted
          ceilings would be one-third greater than their width. For other
          rooms, Palladio used Pythagoras' theory of means to determine
          their heights. Accordingly, there were three types of means:
          arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic.</p>

          <h2>MODULOR</h2>
        </header>

        <p>Le Corbusier developed his proportioning system, the Modulor, to order "the
          dimensions of that which contains and that which is contained." He saw the
          measuring tools of the Greeks, Egyptians, and other high civilizations as
          being "infinitely rich and subtle because they formed part of the mathematics
          of the human body, gracious, elegant, and firm, the source of that harmony
          which moves us, beauty." He therefore based his measuring tool, the Modulor,
          on both mathematics (the aesthetic dimensions of the Golden Section and
          the Fibonacci Series), and the proportions of the human body (functional
          dimensions).</p>

          the human figure.</p>

          <h2>KEN</h2>
        </header>

        <p>The traditional Japanese unit of measure, the shaku,
          was originally imported from China. It is almost
          equivalent to the English foot and divisible into
          decimal units. Another unit of measure, the ken, was
          introduced in the latter half of Japan's Middle Ages.
          Although it was originally used simply to designate
          the interval between two columns and varied in
          size, the ken was soon standardized for residential
          architecture. Unlike the module of the Classical
          Orders, which was based on the diameter of a column
          and varied with the size of a building, the ken became
          an absolute measurement.</p>

        <p>The ken, however, was not only a measurement for the
          construction of buildings. It evolved into an aesthetic
          module that ordered the structure, materials, and
          space of Japanese architecture.</p>

                center of a traditional Japanese house, the
                tokonoma is located in its most formal room.</b></p>

        <p>Two methods of designing with the ken modular grid
          developed that affected its dimension. In the Inakama method, the ken grid of 6 shaku determined the
          center-to-center spacing of columns. Therefore, the
          standard tatami floor mat (3 x 6 shaku or 0.5 x 1 ken) varied slightly to allow for the thickness of the
          columns.</p>

        <p>In the Kyo-ma method, the floor mat remained
          constant (3.15 x 6.30 shaku) and the column
          spacing (ken module) varied according to the size of
          the room and ranged from 6.4 to 6.7 shaku.</p>

        <p>The size of a room is designated by the number of its
          floor mats. The traditional floor mat was originally
          proportioned to accommodate two persons sitting
          or one person sleeping. As the ordering system of
          the ken grid developed, however, the floor mat lost its
          dependence on human dimensions and was subjected
          to the demands of the structural system and its
          column spacing.</p>

        <p>Because of their 1:2 modularity, the floor mats can
          be arranged in a number of ways for any given room
          size. And for each room size, a different ceiling height
          is established according to the following:</p>

        <p>height of the ceiling (shaku), measured from the top
          of the frieze board = number of mats x 0.3.</p>

          <h2>ANTHROPOMETRY</h2>
        </header>

        <p>Anthropometry refers to the measurement of the size and proportions of the
          human body. While the architects of the Renaissance saw the proportions of
          the human figure as a reaffirmation that certain mathematical ratios reflected
          the harmony of their universe, anthropometric proportioning methods seek
          not abstract or symbolic ratios, but functional ones. They are predicated
          on the theory that forms and spaces in architecture are either containers
          or extensions of the human body and should therefore be determined by its
          dimensions.</p>

        <p>The difficulty with anthropometric proportioning is the nature of the data
          required for its use. For example, the dimensions given here in millimeters are
          average measurements and are merely guidelines that should be modified to
          satisfy specific user needs. Average dimensions must always be treated with
          caution since variations from the norm will always exist due to the difference
          between men and women, among various age and racial groups, even from one
          individual to the next.</p>

        <p>The dimensions and proportions of the human body affect the
          proportion of things we handle, the height and distance of things
          we try to reach, and the dimensions of the furnishings we use for
          sitting, working, eating, and sleeping. There is a difference between our
          structural dimensions and those dimensional requirements that result
          from how we reach for something on a shelf, sit down at a table, walk
          down a set of stairs, or interact with other people. These are functional
          dimensions and will vary according to the nature of the activity engaged
          in and the social situation.</p>

        <p>A special field that has developed from a concern with human factors
          is ergonomics—the applied science that coordinates the design
          of devices, systems, and environments with our physiological and
          psychological capacities and requirements.</p>

        <p>In addition to the elements that we use in a building, the dimensions of the
          human body also affect the volume of space we require for movement, activity,
          and rest. The fit between the form and dimensions of a space and our own body
          dimensions can be a static one as when we sit in a chair, lean against a railing, or
          nestle within an alcove space. There can also be a dynamic fit as when we enter
          a building's foyer, walk up a stairway, or move through the rooms and halls of a
          building. A third type of fit is how a space accommodates our need to maintain
          appropriate social distances and to have control over our personal space.</p>

          <h2>SCALE</h2>
        </header>

        <p>While proportion pertains to an ordered set of mathematical
          relationships among the dimensions of a form or space, scale
          refers to how we perceive or judge the size of something in
          relation to something else. In dealing with the issue of scale,
          therefore, we are always comparing one thing to another.</p>

        <p>The entity an object or space is being compared to may be
          an accepted unit or standard of measurement. For example,
          we can say that a table is, according to the U.S. Customary
          System, 3 feet wide, 6 feet long, and 29 inches high. Using the
          International Metric System, the same table would measure
          914 mm wide, 1829 mm long, and 737 mm high. The physical
          dimensions of the table have not changed, just the system
          used to calculate its size.</p>

        <p>In drawing, we use a scale to specify the ratio that determines
          the relationship between an illustration to that which it
          represents. For example, the scale of an architectural drawing
          notes the size of a depicted building in comparison to the real
          thing.</p>

          <h2>VISUAL SCALE</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Of particular interest to designers is the notion of visual scale,
          which refers not to the actual dimensions of things, but rather
          to how small or large something appears to be in relation to its
          normal size or to the size of other things in its context.</p>

        <p>When we say something is small-scale or miniature, we usually
          mean that thing appears to be smaller than its usual size.
          Likewise, something that is large-scale is perceived as being
          larger than what is normal or expected.</p>

        <p>We speak of urban scale when we refer to the size of a project
          in the context of a city, or neighborhood scale when we judge a
          building appropriate to its locale within a city, or street scale
          when we note the relative sizes of elements fronting a roadway.</p>

        <p>At the scale of a building, all elements, no matter how plain or
          unimportant they may be, have a certain size. Its dimensions
          may be predetermined by the manufacturer, or they may be
          selected by the designer from a range of choices. Nevertheless,
          we perceive the size of each element in relation to other parts
          or to the whole of a composition.</p>

            <p><b>Mechanical scale: the size or proportion of something relative to an accepted standard of
                measurement.</b></p>
            <p><b>Visual scale: the size or proportion an element appears to have relative to other elements of
                known or assumed size. </b></p>

        <p>For example, the size and proportion of windows in a building
          facade are visually related to one another as well as to the
          spaces between them and the overall dimensions of the facade.
          If the windows are all of the same size and shape, they establish
          a scale relative to the size of the facade.</p>

        <p>If, however, one of the windows is larger than the others, it
          would create another scale within the composition of the
          facade. The jump in scale could indicate the size or significance
          of the space behind the window, or it could alter our perception
          of the size of the other windows or the overall dimensions of
          the facade.</p>

        <p>Many building elements have sizes and characteristics that are
          familiar to us and which we use to gauge the sizes of other elements
          around them. Such elements as residential window units and
          doorways help give us an idea of how large a building is and how many
          stories it has. Stairs and certain modular materials, such as brick
          and concrete block, help us measure the scale of a space. Because
          of their familiarity, these elements, if oversized, can also be used
          to deliberately alter our perception of the size of a building form or
          space.</p>

                get closer, however, we see that the actual entrances are really simple
                doors within the larger portals and are scaled to our dimensions, to
                a human scale.</b></p>

          <h2>HUMAN SCALE</h2>
        </header>

        <p>Human scale in architecture is based on the dimensions and
          proportions of the human body. It has already been mentioned in the
          section on anthropometric proportioning that our dimensions vary from
          individual to individual and should not be used as an absolute measuring
          device. We can, however, gauge a space whose width is such that we can
          reach out and touch its walls. Similarly, we can judge its height if we can
          reach up and touch the ceiling plane overhead. Once we can no longer do
          these things, we must rely on visual rather than tactile clues to give us
          a sense of the scale of a space.</p>

        <p>For these clues, we can use elements that have human meaning and
          whose dimensions are related to the dimensions of our posture, pace,
          reach, or grasp. Such elements as a table or chair, the risers and treads
          of a stairway, the sill of a window, and the lintel over a doorway, not only
          help us judge the size of a space but also give it a human scale.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/form space and order/Proportion and Scale/HUMAN SCALE 1.png" alt="Proportion and Scale"
            style="height: 18%; width: 45%;">
          <img src="images/form space and order/Proportion and Scale/HUMAN SCALE 2.png" alt="Proportion and Scale"
            style="height: 18%; width: 30%;">
          <img src="images/form space and order/Proportion and Scale/HUMAN SCALE 3.png" alt="Proportion and Scale"
            style="height: 18%; width: 24%;">

        <p>While something that is monumental in scale makes us feel small in comparison,
          a space that is intimate in scale describes an environment in which we feel
          comfortable, in control, or important. Intimate settings of tables and lounge
          chairs in a large hotel lobby tell us something about the expansiveness of the
          space as well as define comfortable, human-scale areas within it. A stairway
          leading up to a second-story balcony or loft can give us an idea of the vertical
          dimension of a room as well as suggest a human presence. A window in a
          blank wall conveys something about the space behind it and also leaves the
          impression that it is inhabited.</p>


        <p>Of a room's three dimensions, its height has
          a greater effect on its scale than either its
          width or length. While the walls of the room
          provide enclosure, the height of the ceiling plane
          overhead determines its qualities of shelter and
          intimacy.</p>

        <p>Raising the ceiling height of a 12 X 16-foot
          room from 8 to 9 feet will be more noticeable
          and affect its scale more than if its width were
          increased to 13 feet or its length to 17 feet.
          While the 12 X 16-foot room with a 9-foot
          ceiling might feel comfortable to most people, a
          50 X 50-foot space with the same ceiling height
          would begin to feel oppressive.</p>

        <ul>
          <p>In addition to the vertical dimension of a space,
            other factors that affect its scale are:</p>
          <li>
            <p>the shape, color, and pattern of it's bounding surface.</p>
          </li>
