          <h2>New Construction versus Remodeling</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Deciding wisely whether to build a new home or remodel an existing one requires careful thought.
          Construction
          and remodeling both demand a commitment of time, money, and effort. Consider the following advantages and
          disadvantages of each option.</p>
        <div>

          <header>
            <h2>New Construction</h2>
          </header>
          <p>Building a home from the ground up requires architect-or engineered-approved blueprints drawn in
            accordance
            with local zoning laws and any restrictive covenants for the area or development, a building permit
            approved
            by the municipality, someone to oversee the construction, and building inspectors to ensure that the
            work is
            sound and safe and meets the local laws known as building codes.</p>

          <header>
            <h4>The advantages of new construction are these:</h4>
          </header>

          <ul id="new_construction">

            <li>
              <p>The location and orientation of the home on the site can be custom selected.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>There is satisfaction in designing and building a unique, personal space that has never before been
                occupied.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The plan can be completely customized as to number, placement, and shape of rooms, site
                orientation,
                exterior style, and window and door openings.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>New construction can incorporate the newest developments in building materials, technology, wiring,
                heating and cooling and communication systems, plumbing and other fixtures, and finish materials.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>New materials require less upkeep because of their newness. Wisely chosen, they can be relatively
                maintenance free and aesthetically pleasing for many years to come.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The space is unoccupied during construction. There is no need to live with or work in the mess.
              </p>
            </li>

            <header>
              <h4>The disadvantages of new construction include:</h4>
            </header>

            <li>
              <p>Costs for new construction are almost always higher than the costs of buying existing structures.
                Both
                material and labor costs have risen sharply in the past decade.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The time frame typically extends longer in reality than in the estimate. This can cause frustration
                and
                problems with moving or current occupancy.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Travel to and from the site is time consuming.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The need to oversee the construction, even with a general contractor, is real. The owner should be
                a
                part of the process to determine if the interim results are satisfactory.</p>
            </li>

          <ul id="Remodeling">
            <header>
              <h2>Remodeling</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Remodeling is a process that has a wide scope. A remodel can be as small as adding a closet or
              building
              in a water fountain or as large as doubling the size of the building or home through a major addition.
              Some remodeling requires building permits, contracts with those who will perform all or parts of the
              work,
              and major time and expense. Other remodeling projects can be accomplished in a short time by the owner
              or
              subcontractors. Remodeling often entails demolition and reconstruction, again, as a large or small
              project. Remodeling assumes that parts of the building or home are satisfactory but others need rework
              to
              make them more functional. However, sometimes a building or home will be completely gutted, interior
              walls
              realigned, and new electrical, plumbing, and HVAC systems installed.</p>

            <h4>The advantages of remodeling are these:</h4>

            <li>
              <p>Relocation can be avoided. This is a major reason why most people remodel. Business location or
                residential neighborhood, friends, schools, and proximity to shopping and services may be so
                advantageous that there is no desire to uproot and move.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Changes in an existing plan can take place one at a time, over a long time, with much less pressure
                to
                accomplish than new construction. There is time to live with the idea, plan it out carefully,
                execute it
                in a way that suits the owner or occupant, and control the size or scale of the project.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Remodels can be accomplished in stages or in parts of the structure and by various individuals or
                teams. A general contractor or remodeler may do the work, or the owner may hire professionals, such
                as a
                framer, plumber, electrician, drywall installer, or painter, or may elect a do-it-yourself approach.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The cost may be less than that of new construction, de-pending on the extent of the remodel, who
                does
                the work, and how it is accomplished.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The area to be remodeled may not dramatically affect living or working in the space.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The great features of a building or home can be kept while upgrading. This often produces a very
                satisfying result. There is no need to give up what works or what you love about the space; just
                improve
                it to work out the little things that may be causing current frustration or not meeting a need.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Older homes, with their vintage charms and historical character, often need upgrading of the
                structure
                or of electrical, plumbing, or HVAC systems. They may also have too many small rooms for today's
                lifestyles, or the owner may desire to remove previous remodeling to restore the home or building to
                a
                prior or original floor plan. Historic buildings and homes are often adapted to new uses; an old
                warehouse can become new offices, an old home can become a boutique, or a barn can be-come a home
                through the process of remodeling.</p>
            </li>

            <h4>The disadvantages of remodeling are as follows:</h4>

            <li>
              <p>Living with the mess is an emotional and physical strain. It may cause people to be irritable and
                put
                strain on relationships. Moving out during a remodel is often advisable, depending on the extent and
                location of the remodel. This also requires effort, is expensive and time consuming, and is
                difficult
                for everyone involved.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The presence of subcontractors in the work or living space impinges on privacy and disrupts
                routines.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Removing walls sometimes yields a surprise. It's not uncommon, especially in older buildings, to
                discover unexpected conditions, such as a hidden fireplace or chimney flue, rotted floorboards or
                ceiling joists, or a complete change in building methods. These will require more time and money to
                correct and at times may completely alter the master plan; what you thought you could do may not be
                possible after all.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Whether or not there are unhappy surprises, making decisions and discussing the project as it
                progresses is necessary, takes time, and can be stressful. </p>
            </li>

            <header>
              <h4>In both the new construction and remodeling
                processes, a few rules apply:</h4>
            </header>

            <li>
              <p>Each is a difficult process; it is physically, mentally, and emotionally exhausting to build or
                remodel. Many decisions must be made, and disagreement is common. Cooperation and negotiating will
                help
                save sanity and preserve relationships.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Not everything runs smoothly. Problems arise in delivery, materials, interpretation, and
                workmanship.
                These frustrations can cause bad feelings and real frustration. Murphy's law applies: If anything
                can go
                wrong, it will.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Most projects take longer than anticipated especially if the project is a DIY (do-it-yourself),
                which
                typically takes two to three times what was originally estimated.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>Costs often go up as decisions are made to upgrade to a better product or expand the plan in some
                way.
                Ideally this should not happen if thorough research has been done in advance and commitments to
                specific
                products have been made. However, there are many variables, particularly in remodeling. When the
                demolition portion of the remodel begins, the structure or new perspective of the space will often
                change the master plan a little and may require extra structural support, upgraded wiring, or repair
                of
                other defects. Sometimes you don't know exactly what you're working with until the walls come down.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>People doing the work may not always use the techniques you would choose. Also, if they have other
                projects going on at the same time and therefore must divide their time, they may not come to your
                job
                consistently. Waiting for sub-contractors is a common frustration.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>The necessity of having building inspectors often costs additional time, effort, and money. They
                typically find more things to be fixed with each inspection and will not issue an occupancy permit
                until
                all their demands are satisfied.</p>
            </li>

                room. The new, more spacious kitchen is in the addition. This
                remodeled space is handsome, livable, and meets the needs of

        <div id="Economic_Considerations">

          <header>
            <h3>Economic Considerations</h3>
          </header>

          <p>Economy is an important consideration in planning space. In most cases, new construction will have a
            financial limit (a maximum amount that can be spent) imposed by the client or by the lending
            institution.
          </p>

          <p>Therefore, the architect, designer, and builder, as well as the client or homeowner, need to make
            careful
            and wise decisions concerning the amount of space. This is because the actual square footage is
            proportional
            to the cost of the building or home. </p>

          <ol>

            <p>Total price is estimated on a cost per square foot. The cost per square foot will vary according to
              the
              location, the building materials used, the amount of skilled labor involved, and the number of luxury
              items incorporated. A total building cost of $100 per square foot (excluding the building lot or
              property
              costs) can be calculated as follows:</p>
            <li>
              <p>An 800-square-foot building would cost approximately $80,000.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>A 1,200-square-foot building would be about $120,000.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>A 2,000-square-foot building would cost $200,000.</p>
            </li>

            <p>Therefore, smaller total square footage means lower building costs when building one-story or
              main-level
              only homes. However, second-story and basement living space is less costly to construct than
              main-floor
              living space. </p>

            <p>This is because the roof and foundation can serve all levels and because plumbing and electrical
              systems
              can be centralized and fi replaces stacked. Further, room inside an attic (termed a “half story”) can
              be
              quite economical since the attic space would often be there anyway. </p>

            <p>With the addition of dormer windows or skylights and perhaps a steeper pitch in the roof, the attic
              space
              can become not only livable but charming because of its angles and nooks. </p>

            <p>In the case of basements, there may be need for a crawl space or, where there is a deep frost line
              that
              would require sinking a deeper foundation, this space can be extended to become living space.
              Basements
              are a modest addition to the initial building cost in most cases. The attic or basement space may be
              framed with the home but finished at a later date, offering added living space as the need arises.
            </p>

            <p>Therefore, the initial cost of the home would not reflect the potential of that addition of living
              space
              in a high cost per square foot. In this way, a home with half-story and basement space can be more
              affordable in the long run than a home of the same square footage on one level only.</p>

              <h3>principal and Interest Only Fixed Rates</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>for a 15 year loan, the cost of the loan when paid in full is between one-and-one-half and two
                    times the loan amount. </p>
                  <p>For a 30-year loan, it is from two to three times the loan amount.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Lenders apply the payments in such a way that most of the interest is paid at the beginning of
                    the loan. By increasing the amount of principal paid each month, the borrower can shorten the
                    term
                    of the loan. For example, an additional $50 a month applied to the principal on a 30-year loan
                    can
                    reduce the years of payment to around 14 to 18 years. Making a half-monthly payment every two
                    weeks—a convenient schedule for borrowers who receive a paycheck twice a month—is another way to
                    reduce the overall loan term.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>This chart calculates principal and interest only. Property taxes and home owners or hazard
                    insurance will increase payment amounts, to be held in escrow by the lending institution or paid
                    directly by the home owner.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Mortgage payments typically include money to be set aside, or escrowed, for home owners
                    insurance
                    and property taxes. Some borrowers are also required to carry private mortgage insurance (PMI).
                    The
                    calculations in this table do not include these amounts, nor do they include loan origination
                    costs
                    such as points or commitment fees.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    The hypothetical mortgages in this table are fixed-rate loans. Payment calculations for
                    adjustable-rate or balloon mortgages would be significantly different from the calculations
                    shown
                    here.
                  </p>
                </li>

                <p>A general rule is that a home purchase price should not exceed two and one-half times the annual
                  income. Housing costs (mortgage payment, property taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs,
                  maintenance,
                  and any cooperative or condominium fees) should not exceed 28 percent of the gross monthly income.
                  This housing-to-income ratio is Expressed:
                </p>
                <p>Housing costs / Gross Income =28% or Less </p>

                <p>A second guideline expressed as a ratio is debt to income, where debt including housing costs
                  plus
                  other
                  Long-term debts (more than ten months to repay) should not exceed 36 percent of the gross monthly
                  income:
                </p>

                <p>
                  Housing costs + Debts / Gross Income = 36% or Less
                </p>
              </ul>
