        <h1>ROOF STRUCTURES</h1>
      </header>

      <div id="ROOF_STRUCTURES">
        <p>Roof structures, like floor structures, are horizontal
          spanning systems. However, while floor structures provide
          flat and level platforms for the support of our activities and
          furnishings, roof structures have a vertical aspect that can
          dramatically impact the exterior form of a building as well
          as the quality of the spatial volumes beneath their canopy.
          A roof structure may be flat or pitched, gabled or hipped,
          broad and sheltering, or rhythmically articulated.</p>

        <p>It may be
          exposed with edges flush with or overhanging the exterior
          walls, or it may be concealed from view, hidden behind
          a parapet. If its underside remains exposed, the roof also
          transmits its form to the upper boundaries of the interior
          spaces below.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/ROOF STRUCTURES/ROOF STRUCTURES 1.png" alt="VERTICAL DIMENSIONS"
            style="height: 24%; width: 39%;">
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>Because the roof system functions as the primary
          sheltering element for the interior spaces of a building,
          its form and slope must be compatible with the type of
          roofing—shingles, tiles, or a continuous membrane—used
          to shed rainwater and melting snow to a system of drains,
          gutters, and downspouts. The construction of a roof should
          also control the passage of moisture vapor, the infiltration
          of air, and the flow of heat and solar radiation. Depending
          on the type of construction required by the building code,
          the roof structure and assembly may have to resist the
          spread of fire.</p>

        <p>Like floor systems, a roof must be structured to span
          across space and carry its own weight as well as the
          weight of any attached equipment and accumulated rain
          and snow. Flat roofs used as decks are also subject to live
          occupancy loads. In addition to these gravity loads, the
          planes of the roof may be required to resist lateral wind
          and seismic forces, as well as uplifting wind forces, and
          transfer these forces to the supporting structure.</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/ROOF STRUCTURES/ROOF STRUCTURES 2.png" alt="VERTICAL DIMENSIONS"
            style="height: 24%; width: 39%;">
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>Because the gravity loads for a building originate with the
          roof system, its structural layout must correspond to that
          of the column and bearing wall systems through which its
          loads are transferred down to the foundation system. This
          pattern of roof supports and the extent of the roof spans,
          in turn, influences the layout of interior spaces and the
          type of ceiling that the roof structure may support. Long
          roof spans would open up a more flexible interior space
          while shorter roof spans might suggest more precisely
          defined spaces.</p>

        <ul>
          <p>Flat roofs are analogous to floor structures in how they are
            structured and constructed. Their structure may consist of:</p>

          <li>
            <p>teel or timber beams and decking</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Steel or wood joists and sheathing</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Reinforced concrete slabs</p>
          </li>

          <figure>
            <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/ROOF STRUCTURES/Flat Roofs.jpg" alt="VERTICAL DIMENSIONS"
              style="height: 24%; width: 78%;">
          </figure> <br><br>

          <li>
            <p>Flat roofs require a continuous membrane roofing
              material, such as built-up or single-ply roofing.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Flat roof surfaces are not really flat unless ponding—the
              purposeful collecting and holding of rainwater—is
              desired. The minimum recommended slope for draining
              rainwater is 1/4" per foot (1:50).</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The slope usually leads to interior drains; perimeter
              scuppers may be used as overflow drains.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>On roofs with multiple drainage slopes, the minimum
              required slope should be measured at the shallowest
              slope of the roof. This usually occurs along a diagonal
              intersection of two slopes.</p>
          </li>

          </figure> <br><br>

          <li>
            <p>The required minimum slope may be achieved in
              several ways. The slope may be achieved by tapering a
              lightweight concrete topping or using tapered sheets of
              rigid insulation.</p>
          </li>

              style="height: 24%; width: 75%;">
          </figure> <br><br>

          <li>
            <p>The slope can also be constructed by using tapered
              spanning elements, such as trusses with pitched top
              chords or shaped beams or girders with sloping flanges
              or top surfaces.</p>
          </li>

          </figure> <br><br>

          <li>
            <p> A third option is to vary the elevations of the bearing
              surfaces so that the spanning members incline slightly
              as they span from one support to the other.</p>
          </li>

          <p>The roof slope affects the choice of roofing material, the
            requirements for underlayment and eave flashing, and
            design wind loads. Some roofing materials are suitable
            for low-slope roofs; others must be laid over roof surfaces
            with steeper pitches to shed rainwater properly.</p>

          <li>
            <p>Sloping roofs shed rainwater more easily to eave
              gutters more easily than flat roofs.</p>

          <p>As with floor structures, the nature of the
            roofing material and the manner in which
            it is laid to shed rainwater determines the
            pattern of the secondary supports, which in
            turn dictates the direction and spacing of
            the primary spanning members of the roof
            structure. Understanding these relationships
            aids in developing the framing pattern for a roof
            structure.</p>

          <li>
            <p>Roofing shingles, tiles, or panels may require
              either solid or spaced sheathing.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Sheathing spans across the roof slope.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Sheathing supports span down the roof
              slope.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Depth and spanning capability of sheathing
              determines the spacing of its supports.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>The least complicated method for framing
              a sloped roof plane uses relatively small,
              closely spaced rafters that span down the
              slope and support solid or spaced sheathing.</p>
          </li>

          <ul>
            <p>Wood Rafter Span Ranges:</p>

            <li>
              <p>2x6 can span up to 10' (3.0 m);</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>2x8 can span up to 14' (4.3 m);</p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>2x10 can span up to 16' (4.9 m);</p>
            </li>

      <div class="Roof Beams Parallel with Slope">

        <p>There are alternative ways in which to frame steel
          and timber roof structures, depending on the direction
          and spacing of the roof beams, the elements used to
          span the beam spacing, and the overall depth of the
          construction assembly.</p>

        <header>
          <h2>Roof Beams Parallel with Slope</h2>
        </header>

        <p>The steel or timber roof beams may be spaced 4' to
          8' (1220 to 2440) o.c. and spanned with steel or wood
          decking. The beams may be supported by girders,
          columns, or a reinforced concrete or masonry bearing
          wall.</p>

        <p>In a two-layer system, the roof beams may be spaced
          farther apart and support a series of purlins. These
          purlins, in turn, are spanned with roof decking or a
          rigid, sheet roofing material.</p>

        <p>A two-layer structure, the roof
          beams support a conventional system of rafters.</p>

        <p>The roof beams may be spaced close enough to be
          spanned with roof decking. Spaced farther apart,
          the beams can support a series of secondary beams
          parallel with the slope.</p>

        <p>When a series of shaped roof trusses is used in place
          of the primary roof beams, the lower chords and
          webs of the trusses will materially affect the quality
          of the space.</p>

          <h2>Multiple-Slope Roofs</h2>
        </header>

        <p>Sloping roof planes can be combined to create a variety
          of roof forms. One of the most common is the gable roof,
          consisting of two roof planes that slope downward from a
          central ridge.</p>

        <p>There are two principal ways for framing a gable roof. A
          ridge beam supported by two or more columns can support
          a series of simple rafter spans.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/ROOF STRUCTURES/Multiple_Slope Roofs.jpg" alt="ROOF STRUCTURES"

          </figcaption>
        </figure> <br><br>

        <p>Alternatively, one series of rafters can rise and oppose the
          rafters rising from the other side, eliminating the need for
          a beam at the ridge. A ridge board is used instead simply
          to aid in aligning the rafters during construction. This
          method produces horizontal thrusts at the base of both
          sets of sloping rafters, which must be resisted by a tension
          tie connecting each pair of opposing rafters.</p>

        <p>It is useful to think of any roof composition as a number of
          sloping planes that meet or intersect at either ridges, hips,
          or valleys, keeping in mind the resulting drainage pattern
          for shedding rainwater and melting snow. Ridges, hips,
          and valleys all represent breaks in a roof plane that require
          a line of support, which may be in the form of a beam or
          truss supported by columns or bearing walls.</p>

        <p>The spanning elements of hip roofs, domes, and similar
          roof forms can oppose and buttress each other at their
          peak. To counteract the horizontal thrust that results at
          their base supports, however, tension ties or rings, or a
          series of linked horizontal beams are required.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Ridges are the lines of intersection formed where
              two sloping planes of a roof meet at the top.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Hips are the inclined projecting angles formed
              by the junction of two adjacent sloping sides of
              a roof.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Valleys are the internal angles formed at
              the intersection of two inclined roof surfaces and
              toward which rainwater flows.</p>

            <p>A break in the roof plane that ends within a space

              columns or a bearing wall.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>An alternative would be to have a shaped girder
              or truss span the space and support the ridge or
              valley beam as a concentrated load.</p>

          <li>
            <p>A break in the roof plane that extends across
              a space can be supported by a clear-spanning
              beam or truss supported at the ends by perimeter
              columns or bearing walls. For example, a series of
              deep trusses can clear-span the width of a space
              to create a sawtooth roof.</p>

        <p>Curved roof surfaces may be structured by using
          spanning elements, such as built-up or custom-
          rolled steel beams, glue-laminated timber beams, or
          trusses that are shaped to match the desired profile
          of the form or space.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Concrete slabs can also be formed to the desired
              curvature and extruded in the longitudinal
              direction. For example, a barrel shell can be
              extruded to behave as a deep beam with a
              curved section spanning in the longitudinal
              direction. If the barrel shell is relatively short,
              however, it exhibits archlike action and tie rods or
              transverse rigid frames are required to counteract
              the outward thrusts of the arching action. </p>

            <p>Shaped concrete members may be cast in place,
              but this would be economical only in situations
              where the spans are large and repetition
              minimal. For repetitive elements, precast concrete
              members are more economical. A shaped
              structural element is most efficient when its
              profile reflects the moment diagram for its span.
              For example, a section should be deeper where
              the bending moment is greater.</p>

            <p>When framing a curved roof with one-way
              spanning elements, the same considerations
              regarding roofing material and the direction of
              primary and secondary spans apply as they do for
              flat and sloping roofs.</p>

          <p>As the scale of a structure increases, interior lines of
            support may become necessary to keep the roof spans
            within reasonable limits. Whenever possible, these lines of
            support should reinforce the spatial quality of the volumes
            being developed by the roof form. Where interior supports
            would interfere with the functioning of a space and clear
            spans are desirable, as in sports arenas and concert halls,
            long-spanning roof structures become necessary.</p>
