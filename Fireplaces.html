            <h2>Fireplaces and Chimneypieces</h2>
          </header>
          <p>The fireplace is another detail often associated with pleasant memories. The leap and flicker of
            constantly changing flames and the crackle of the burning wood create a mood of warmth and evoke memories of
            a chilly winter evening by a fire with family or friends.</p>

          <p>For thousands of years, fire was the only source of heat in buildings. During the middle Ages, when
            someone discovered that a hole in the wall with a hood could siphon the smoke from a fire, the design
            significance of the fireplace was instantly elevated. Before that, the fire had been built in a pit in the
            floor and the smoke escaped through cracks or vents in the roof. </p>

          <p>The hood provided new possibilities for design. Because it was a source of warmth, the fireplace was the
            logical focal point in the room, and designers lavished it with attention. Through the years, the basic
            technology of the fireplace has changed very little. </p>

          <p>It is the design of the decorative chimneypiece that has changed the most. Each new period saw changes in
            the style of the chimneypiece that gave the fireplace the proper character for its surroundings. The
            projecting shelf of a chimneypiece is called a mantel.</p>

          <p>A fire requires fuel, heat, and oxygen. As it burns, the fire consumes oxygen, and this creates a draft as
            more air is drawn in to feed the fire that warms the air. The fireplace works on the principle that warm
            air rises, drawing the smoke off as it ascends and radiating some heat into the room. </p>

          <p>The rising air creates a suction that also pulls air from the room. As the intensity of the fire dies, it
            begins to suck precious warm air from the room. To keep the warm air in the house from escaping, it is
            necessary to close the front of the fireplace with glass or metal doors. The fireplace is made of several
            components:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>The hearth is the noncombustible slab that forms the base for the fire and projects into the room to
                prevent embers or sparks from charring the floor.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The firebox contains the fire and is built of masonry or metal on top of the hearth.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The surround is the noncombustible piece that frames the opening of the firebox. It is frequently made
                of tile, marble, or other stone.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>The flue is the chimney pipe that is separated from the firebox by a movable damper that controls the
                flow of air and escape of smoke.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Zero-clearance fireplace units are self-contained units with triple-insulated walls that allow
                placement in walls without firebrick or masonry.</p>
              <p>Fireplaces can be built in any form—imagination and function are the only real restrictions. However,
                the most common types are flush-face, projecting, hooded, corner, raised, freestanding, and stoves:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>The breast (face) of the flush-face fireplace is even, or flush, with the plane of the surrounding
                    wall. Because the flush-face tends to be less decorative, it is well suited to contemporary
                    interiors where it often consists of a surround and a simple molding. Several historically styled
                    fireplaces are also flush-faced with or without a mantel.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>The breast of a projecting fireplace projects into the room, forming a mantel. This type is
                    adaptable to clean contemporary versions as well as more decorative historical types.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>A hooded fireplace incorporates a projecting hood that may be formed in nearly any shape, from
                    rounded to angled to boxlike. This was the first type of fireplace to be built during the late
                    Middle Ages and early Re-naissance, used also in both French and Italian Rustic interiors.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>The corner fireplace is located in the corner of a room; it may have a hood or may be built like a
                    standard fireplace. Because they cut off the corner of a room, corner fireplaces often have
                    inherent problems of balance and line and may present challenges in furniture placement.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Many fireplaces are designed with a raised hearth built just in front of the firebox or extending
                    the entire length of the wall. With a raised hearth, the firebox is elevated so that it can be seen
                    more easily through the furniture grouping that often surrounds a fireplace. </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <p>The raised hearth requires less stooping and has the added advantage of making the fireplace easier to
              fuel and clean. This type of hearth also provides a nice place to sit next to the fire.</p>
            <li>
              <p>Two-way fireplaces have openings on two sides as a dividing wall between two rooms, such as
                living/family and dining rooms, where the firebox is open on opposite sides (180 degrees). A corner
                two-way unit has two openings in a 90-degree or L-shaped arrangement.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>A free-standing fireplace is a metal unit or other fire-place that is placed in the room away from
                the wall, with the flue or chimney pipe exposed. The fireplace unit may be placed on a raised platform
                or may rest at floor level.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Until the advent of central heating, the pot-bellied stove was a standard fixture in homes, churches,
                schools, and stores. Today, in areas with cold winters, stoves are still used in some homes. Stoves are
                generally freestanding units placed in front of a noncombustible wall with clearance between the wall
                and the stove. Fireplaces can also be fitted with enclosed stove units called fireplace inserts for
                more efficient use of fuel and little loss of warmed house air. </p>
            </li>
            <p>Some stoves and fireplace inserts are designed with forced-air systems that can heat most of a
              medium-sized house. These draw air from outside; the air is warmed by the stove and then forced by a fan
              into the house, creating positive pressure. When a vent or window at the opposite end of the house is
              opened slightly, the warm air will be drawn to that part of the house. A fresh-air intake pipe to the
              stove will eliminate drafts caused by combustion.</p>

          </ul>
