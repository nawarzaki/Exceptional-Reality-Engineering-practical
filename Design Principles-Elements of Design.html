        <h2>Elements of Design</h2>

        <p>Design elements are the concrete, quantifiable components of any design. They embody the principles of
          design and transform theory into reality.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Space.</h4>
            <p> Open and closed areas; space may be positive (filled) or negative (open).</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Shape. </h4>
            <p> Two-dimensional outline, often seen as a geometric figure such as a rectangle or triangle.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Form.</h4>
            <p> Three-dimensional shape, such as a cube, cone, or sphere.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Mass.</h4>
            <p>Weight, density, or relative solidity of a form; mass may be actual or visual.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Line.</h4>
            <p> Connection between two points; line may be vertical, horizontal, angular, or curved.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Texture.</h4>
            <p> Smoothness or roughness of a surface; texture may be read visually or through touch.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Pattern.</h4>
            <p> Arrangement of motifs in a repetitive or varied order; a small pattern may be read visually as
              texture.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Light.</h4>
            <p> Natural, artificial, or a combination of both; light affects the appearance of all other elements
              of
              design.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Color. </h4>
            <p>Hues that vary from light to dark and from intense to dull and can be mixed with one another and
              combined in color schemes; color is the most personal and emotional of the elements of design.</p>
          </li>

        </ul>

      </div>
      <!--Elements_of_Design-->

      <div id="Elements_and_Style">
        <br>

        <h3>Elements & Style</h3>

        <p>Design principles are the abstract concepts that constitute the theory, bylaws, or governing ideas that
          determine the success of a design. Each element in a design can be evaluated according to these
          principles.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Scale. </h4>
            <p>Although the actual dimensions of two objects may be similar, one may be of a visually heavier
              scale
              than the other because of its weight or mass and the selection of material. For example, a glass
              table
              on legs will appear smaller-scaled than a solid wooden chest table. While the overall dimensions
              might
              be exactly the same, the glass-topped table allows us to see through the piece, which visually
              scales it
              down and makes it appear smaller than the wooden piece.</p>

            <figure>
              <img src="images/pedestal table.png" alt="Scale." style="height:600px ; width:500px">
              <figcaption>Large scale is evident in the large bulbous turning
                and overall size of pedestal table. Dark colors, as seen in the
                table and broad plank hardwood ﬂ oor make the scale seem even
                larger. The drapery fabric pattern and pendant light ﬁ xture are
                large scale, as well.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>In choosing or judging scale, perhaps the most important consideration is human scale. Very large
              and
              very small scale often feel awkward to people. Although grand scale is impressive and dramatic in
              public
              architecture, and small scale is wonderful for children, for the majority of adults, scale is most
              appropriate when it complements and easily accommodates the average human form. Because we are most
              comfortable with these dimensions, the standard ceiling height in homes is 245cm and chairs and
              sofas
              generally have a standard seating height and depth. Floor plans are drawn to scale, with 6mm, 3mm,
              or
              0.6mm usually equaling 30 cm.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Proportion.</h4>
            <p>Size relationship or ratio of parts to whole, such as the size of a chair in relation to the size
              of
              its
              arms.</p>
            <header>The golden section refers </header>
            <p>To proportions of parts to one another and to the whole. The progressions—3 to 5 to 8 to 13 to 21,
              and
              so
              on—are considered pleasing ratios or proportions as they relate to one another and roughly equate
              the
              theory of the golden mean.</p><br>
            <p>Further, these increments can be translated into sides of rectangles, called golden rectangles that
              form
              the basis for a study of good proportions. For example, a table or art piece 3 feet by 5 feet is a
              pleasing proportion, as are multiples (or divisions) of those dimensions: 12 by 20 (4 times 3 and 4
              times
              5) or 15 by 25 (5 times 3 and 5 times 5).</p><br>
            <p>Golden section, and golden rectangle are examples of how harmonious proportions can be calculated.

          <li>
            <h4>Balance.</h4>
            <p>Equilibrium achieved by arranging components symmetrically, asymmetrically, or radially.</p><br>

            <p><b>We naturally seek balance in our interiors. This state of equilibrium is achieved in one of
                three
                ways: through symmetrical or formal balance, through asymmetrical or informal balance, or by
                radial
                balance.</b></p>
          </li>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/Symmetrical, bisymmetrical, or formal balance.png"
              alt="Symmetrical_bisymmetrical_or_formal_balance" style="height:600px ;width:650px">
            <figcaption>
              <p>Symmetrical, bisymmetrical, or formal balance is seen in the placement of the two identical sofas
                and
                end tables, the French doors ﬂanking the artistic ﬁreplace, and the symmetrical composition of the
                beams.</p>
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <li>
            <h4>Symmetrical Balance</h4>
            <p>Symmetrical balance is also known as for-mal, bisymmetrical, or passive balance. Symmetrical
              balance
              creates a mirror image by the placement of items that are exactly the same on both sides of a
              central
              point.</p>
            <p>Symmetrical balance suggests restraint, refinement, orderliness, and formality. Bisymmetrical
              balance
              is passive because it requires no judgment; we know exactly what to expect. Because for-mal balance
              is
              predictable, it adds a type of steadiness and durability to interior design</p>
            <p>In fact, it has been said that a really good symmetrical composition always contains elements of
              asymmetry. The symmetrical nature of historic designs was broken by asymmetric placement of figures
              in a
              frieze or by inclusion of dissimilar sculptural pieces in symmetrical niches. Rigid symmetry is less
              suitable to today`s less formal and more relaxed lifestyle.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/symmetry.png" alt="symmetry" style="height:600px ;width:650px">
              <figcaption>
                Studied symmetry is found in the matching bookcases, chairs, and
                accessories. The asymmetrical placement of the plants, art, and door relieves the
                exactness.
              </figcaption>
            </figure>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Asymmetrical Balance</h4>
            <p>Asymmetrical balance is also known as informal, active, optical, or occult balance. Asymmetrical
              balance can be accomplished in two ways:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Dissimilar objects can be placed at varying distances from the center point.</li>
              <li>Objects of similar visual weight or form may be balanced at equal distance from an imaginary
                central
                dividing line.</li>
              <p>Asymmetrical balance is often difficult to accomplish. It requires finding objects that are
                compatible yet varied enough to be interesting and then arranging the objects, judging the
                arrangement, and often rearranging them over and over until the sense of equilibrium is judged to
                "feel right." This effort justifies the nickname “active,” be-cause it requires active
                participation
                to accomplish.</p>
              <figure>
                <img src="images/Asymmetrical or informal balance.png" alt="Asymmetrical"
                  style="height:600px ;width:500px">
                <figcaption>Asymmetrical or informal balance is evident in the
                  artwork of this Modern staircase area. The graphic red/white and
                  black/gray panels and the pottery arrangements in this lighted
                  niche are different on each side of the center, yet handsomely
                  balanced. Framed artwork on each ﬂanking wall is also placed
                  asymmetrically—at eye level above each set of stairs.</figcaption>
              </figure>
            </ol>

          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Radial Balance.</h4>
            <p>Radial balance is a state of equilibrium based on the circle. It is seen as chairs surrounding a
              round
              table or as concentric circles in a chandelier or lighting fixture. On a small scale, it is seen on
              the
              round dial of a clock; on a larger scale, as circular furniture arrangements of comfortable chairs
              for a
              group gathering. Radial balance can also be seen as spokes extending from a wheel, pedestal table,
              or
              chair base.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Rhythm.</h4>
            <p>Flow of elements, usually organized according to a scheme such as repetition or alternation,
              progression or gradation, transition, opposition or contrast, or radiation.</p>
            <p>Rhythm might be found in the repetitive use of a color, pattern, texture, line, or furniture piece
              or
              style. Architectural detail such as stairs, window panes, and moldings illustrate rhythm.</p>
            <p><b>There are five types of rhythm:</b></p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>Repetition and alternation.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Progression or gradation.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Transition.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Opposition or contrast.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Radiation.</p>
              </li>

            </ol>
            <p>Repetition establishes rhythm through the repetitive use of an element of design, as previously
              suggested.</p>

            <p>For example, a color repeated throughout an interior can establish rhythm if the eye can smoothly
              connect rather than jumping or leaping from colored object to colored object. Repetition is seen in
              rows
              of seats in a church or theater, in a set of books bound to match, or in the same style of lighting
              fixture used many times in a public space.</p>

            <figure>
              <img src="images/Modern-inspired kitchen..png" alt="Modern_inspired_kitchen"
                style="height:600px ;width:500px">
              <figcaption>Repeated vertical rectangles in the cabinetry, the art glass windows, and the table
                show rhythm by repetition in this early Modern-inspired kitchen.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h4>Progressive rhythm (rhythm by gradation)</h4>
            <p>can also be seen in the value of color, where a color scheme contains shades that vary from very
              light
              values (perhaps on the ceiling) to medium values (on the wall) to dark values (on the floor) and
              where
              the values are further expanded in the furnishings. This light-to-medium-to-dark progressive
              sequence is
              also discussed in Chapter 4 as the concept of value distribution.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/Rhythm by gradation.png" alt="Rhythm_by_gradation" style="height:600px ;width:500px">
              <figcaption> Rhythm by gradation is seen in the decreasing sizes
                of the nesting tables.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Transition is a rhythm that leads the eye without interruption from one point to another. Rhythm by
              transition can be established by a continuous line, usually an architectural element such as a crown
              or
              dado molding</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Opposition, or contrast.</h4>
            <p>, is an abrupt change that forms interesting, repetitive rhythm and is seen in three ways. First,
              it
              can be seen as repetitive 90-degree angles—such as window frames or grids, as built-in units (such
              as
              cabinetry and luminous ceilings), and as the corners of angular furniture or framed artwork. Second,
              opposition.</p>

            <h4>Radiation.</h4>
            <p>closely related to radial balance, is the final type of rhythm. Rhythm established by radiating
              concentric or spoke like lines or forms can be dramatic and impressive. It is sometimes employed as
              designs in large, custom floor coverings in places such as lobbies and ball-rooms or in grand
              ceilings
              where architectural carving or cast plaster creates a radial effect. As such, it can give the room a
              circular, sweeping, rhythmic movement. On a smaller scale, radiation can be seen in place settings
              at a
              round or oval table or as furniture forms in a circular grouping.</p>

            <h4>Emphasis.</h4>
            <p>Enhancement that produces a point of interest or focal point in a design.</p>
            <p>Emphasis is the creation of a focal point—an area visually important enough to draw and hold
              attention.
              Examples of dramatic, demanding focal points include a beautiful fi replace, a view from a window
              (or
              even an art glass window), a wall of dramatic art, or an impressive piece or grouping of furniture.
            </p>
            <p>Some interiors may have multiple focal points, each one with a different level of emphasis,
              progressing
              from the most to the least dominant in order to avoid conflict.</p>
            <figure>
              <img src="images/focal point.png" alt="focal point" style="height:600px ;width:750px">
              <figcaption>This focal point wall consists of eight windows in a bow arrangement with a porthole
                window
                set into the triangular wall
                above with sconce uplighting. The dramatic view of the ocean becomes an extension of this focal
                point.
                The U-shaped furniture ar-
                rangement emphasizes this sweeping architectural/view focal point. The view also expands the space
                of
                this comfortable seating area. </figcaption>

            <h4>Harmony. </h4>
            <p>Compatibility of elements to create a pleasing whole, achieved through unity and variety.
              Harmony is the combination of design elements, architecture, and furnishings into a pleasing or
              orderly
              whole, a state of agreement or a feeling of rightness.
