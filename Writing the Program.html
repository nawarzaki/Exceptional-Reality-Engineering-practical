        <div id="program">

          <h1>Writing the Program</h1>
          <p>Programming is the process of defining the needs of those who will use the space, in advance
            of creating the design. </p>
          <p>Whether for a home kitchen renovation or for a newly constructed
            restaurant, this exercise should evaluate the functional performance, opportunities, and
            constraints of the existing space. Furthermore,
          </p>
          <p>the program should articulate what spaces, features, or attributes must be added to improve
            functionality
            and give an appropriate and compelling character to a space.</p>
          <p>The programmatic goals should be precisely qualified in a
            brief, the written document that outlines all functional, dimensional, and relational requirements. This
            list of objectives will form the basis for evaluating design solutions in subsequent
            phases of the project. </p>
          <br>
          <div>
            <ul>
              <p>Programming can be broken down into three central types of activities:</p>
              <li>
                <p>gathering</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>analyzing</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>documenting information</p>
              </li>

              <ul>


                <p>Within this framework, the process for establishing the project
                  goals and the format of the program wish list can vary widely. </p>


                <li>
                  <p>For small projects, gathering
                    data and analyzing the client's needs are essential; providing a written report is less so. That
                    said, to avoid miscommunication, some record of the process must be made. Thus, programming
                    might
                    consist
                    of a filled-in questionnaire, a detailed interview, or a inventory that defines
                    the microdeterministic issues, such as the number and type of shoes within a closet or the
                    amount of cupboard space needed to accommodate everyday dishes and fine china.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>For large
                    corporate and institutional projects, the designer will need to listen to and put in order
                    criteria
                    from a broad range of stakeholders. Often the interior designer must synthesize conflicting
                    information and make recommendations to the client that can have policy implications beyond
                    physical planning. Documentation is essential. In all cases, the designer is required to
                    prioritize
                    wish
                    lists to make meaningful and finite design decisions. </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Although this step might at times seem extraneous, programming is critical to the design
                    process because it is here that the client's problems and goals are clearly identified. Good
                    communication is key to articulating the program and managing expectations for the design
                    phase. A lack of understanding the goals at this stage may result in cost overruns during the
                    construction phase or, even more detrimental, a project that does not meet the client's basic
                    needs. Ideally, the program serves as a core map from which design objectives, spatial
                    adjacencies,
                    and
                    building constraints are elaborated.</p>

            <h4>Written Program</h4>
            <p>Putting the research information into written form is the last step in the critical
              programming phase of the design process. The resulting document is the key to a
              successful design solution.</p>

          <h4>Design Development: Solving the Problem</h4>
          <p>The creative mind will be generating ideas for design solutions all the way
            through the research phase of the design process</p>

          <div>
            <h4>The design comes into being through:</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Design concept development</p>
              </li>

              </li>
            </ul>

          </div>

          <div>

            <h4>Design Concept Development</h4>
            <p>Concept development usually begins with brainstorming, freely generating many ideas
              without stopping to judge their quality.
              When the best ideas are brought to a degree of completion,
              the design concept begins to emerge. A commitment is then made to the ideas,
              and they are refined to a level where they can be presented for analysis.
            </p>

            <h3>Working Drawings and Speciﬁcations</h3>

            <p>The final design development includes working drawings; final selection of materials,
              finishes, and furnishings; and written specifications. When approved and signed,
              specifications and working drawings may be-come part of the agreement or legal
              contract between the client and the designer. The working drawings are the finished
              mechanical drawings or plans prepared for use by the contractors in making bids and
              completing the construction of the design.
            </p>

          </div>

          <h3>Execution</h3>
          <p>The execution is the implementation of the design. During the execution, demolition is done,
            the actual construction begins, and the materials and furnishings orders are finalized.
            Ordering can be time consuming, yet like each step in the design process, it must be done
            with great care and accuracy. When working to meet a deadline, nothing is more frustrating
            than receiving fewer materials or different furnishings than expected.

          <h3>Post occupancy Evaluation</h3>
          <p>After a period of time in which users have lived with and tested the effectiveness
            of the design, the post occupancy evaluation (POE) reveals how well the design functions.
            The evaluation can be accomplished by on-location interviews and open-ended questionnaires.
            It might seem that the information from such evaluations would be
            too late to be of any value. The value lies in future improvements and in the benefit
            of information that can be implemented in other projects.</p>
