            <h1> Special Considerations in Design</h1>
          </header>
          <h2>Environmental Considerations</h2>

          <p>That responsibility includes avoiding waste and pollution, as well as ensuring long
            life for design so that it will not be prematurely discarded. These are critical features
            of good design, and when design is good, both the environment and users benefit
          </p>

          <br><br>

          <h2>Sustainability</h2>
          <p>Sustainability means thinking about creating buildings and interior environments now, but also
            considering
            how they will be used 50, 100, or more years from now.
            It also includes strategies such as the use of environmentally friendly materials, recycling, and energy
            efficiency.
            And utilizing materials and furnishings that are made from renewable resources with long life spans and
            requiring minimal upkeep.
          </p>
          <br>

            <figcaption> <b>
                <p>(A) This sustainable-source wood ﬂoor is harvested from forest restoration projects and only as
                  small-diameter trees that allow old-growth forest conditions to return, restoring the forest to its
                  original healthy integrity with greatly reduced danger of high-intensity ﬁ re. These smaller trees
                  have
                  a dense grain and hard ﬁber, perfect for beautiful durable ﬂooring and trim.</p>
                <p>(B) Broadloom carpeting and cushions can be sustainable in a number of ways. High-quality, dense
                  tufted
                  carpets in neutral, variegated two-tone effects have a longer physical and aesthetic life span and
                  are
                  less likely to show soiling and wear from trafﬁc. During production, green manufacturing methods use
                  less water, less energy, or renewable energy from bio-based fuel. The carpet may pass the Carpet and
                  Rug
                  Institute (CRI) Green Label Plus, enhancing the contribution toward LEED-certiﬁed buildings. Carpets
                  may
                  contain postconsumer reused content, such as polyethylene (PET—recycled plastic bottles) ﬁber.
                  Carpet
                  can also be collected at recovery and recycling centers, which diverts waste from landﬁlls. Carpet
                  may
                  be made completely or in part from poly lactic acid (corn syrup) renewable ﬁbers, such as DuPont’s
                  Bio-PDO™, a key ingredient in Sorona ﬁber used in Mohawk Industries SmartStrand™ carpet. And new
                  carpets
                  may be engineered to release far less greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in better indoor air
                  quality
                  (IAQ).</p>

            <h3>Use of Resources</h3>
            <p>There are two types of resources used by builders and developers: renewable and nonrenewable. Renewable
              re-sources include materials such as wood from trees that can be replanted in sustained-growth forests.
              Nonrenewable resources include minerals and metals in their raw form as well as fossil fuels.</p>

            <br><br>

            <h3>Resource Efﬁciency and Sustainability</h3>
            <p>Because space for landfills is becoming increasingly hard to find, good ethics point to resource
              efficiency. “Reduce, reuse, recycle, and repair” are old but familiar ideas that constitute resource
              efficiency. Reduce simply means to use less. Reuse means to find new uses for things that have become
              obsolete. Recycle may be synonymous with reuse, but it also means saving used materials for
              reconstitution,
              so they can be used again as if they were new.</p>

                <b>This pleasant interior is an example of modest living. Because of its moderate size, it
                  requires fewer materials and resources to build and furnish; uses less energy to light, heat, and
                  cool; and is less difﬁ cult and costly to maintain than over-large, ostentatious homes.

              <h3>Green Design</h3>
              <p>Green design specification describes selection of materials that produce a sustainable
                environment—the
                materials have come from a renewable source and removing them will not harm the earth`s environment.
                Green
                products will also have been green-manufactured with no adverse effect on the environment, and can
                usually
                be recycled or reused. These kinds of products are free from harmful</p>

              <h3>Lighting and Energy Conservation</h3>
              <p>Lighting accounts for about one-fourth of all electricity used in the United States. Efficient
                electric
                lighting and increased use of natural light could save up to 90 percent of this electricity <br>
                Because of that great efficiency, one of the most significant developments in lighting technology is
                the
                compact fluorescent lamp (CFL). Because fluorescent light is shadow less and has typically been cool
                and
                unflattering, it may have a bad aesthetic reputation. CFLs, however, screw into standard sockets,
                making
                it possible to use them in recessed fixtures and with shades and baffles, giving their light a degree
                of
                direction. In addition, CFLs have a color quality that is very similar to incandescent, and they
                consume
                one-quarter of the energy of, and last up to thirteen times longer than, incandescent lamps.

              <h3>Windows and Energy Conservation</h3>
              <p>On average, 10 to 25 percent of internal winter heating is lost through windows, and similar amounts
                of
                heat gain occur through windows during warm seasons and in warm climates. Low-tech solutions include
                things as simple as caulking window frames to prevent air transfer or planting shade trees for natural
                cooling. About half of all residential windows are single pane, with one sheet of glass. They keep
                rain
                and wind from entering a building but do little to stop heat and cold transfer. They typically have an
                R-value (ability to insulate) of 2.0, which is considered poor. Today`s low-E glazing is double-pane,
                with
                two sheets of glass, and features special coatings, gas fill, good edge seals, insulated frames, and
                airtight construction that provide excellent insulation and prevent negative heat and cold transfer.
                They
                have an excellent R-value of 5.0 or more.</p>

              <h3>Things to consider:</h3>

              <ul>

                <li>
                  <p>Where possible, specify high-performance windows for new construction or retrofit.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Insulate and caulk window frames.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Use low-tech solutions such as planting deciduous trees (those that lose their leaves seasonally)
                    to
                    block the sun`s direct rays in the summer and let in the sun`s rays in the winter.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Design overhangs to block summer sun and admit winter sun as the sun`s angle changes seasonally.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Use screens or awnings for additional sun control.</p>

              <h3>Energy Audits</h3>
              <p>As energy costs continue to rise, more home owners are looking for ways to reduce their carbon
                footprint,
                or consumption of nonrenewable energy. An energy audit is conducted room by room and examines past
                utility
                bills, resulting in a detailed report of all the ways a home uses or wastes energy. It can be
                conducted by
                a professional or as a</p>
              <br> <br>

              <ul>

                <h4>Do-it-yourself (DIY) project by following these steps:</h4>

                <li>
                  <p>Compare utility and energy bills. Compare lighting, heating, and cooling costs by month and
                    compare
                    to
                    previous years, available from customer service of the utility provider. Look for trends in usage
                    and
                    spikes, indicating high energy consumptions. Electric bills are based on kilowatt hours (kWh) and
                    indicate how many are used and how much they cost per kWh per month. Gas usage and costs can be
                    found
                    on
                    monthly statements indicating how many decatherms are used per day and the resulting cost.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Locate air leaks and check insulation. Leaks can decrease energy efficiency by 5 to 30 percent
                    annually. The incense test is to move a lit stick along walls (carefully avoiding draperies and
                    flammables); where the smoke wavers, you have cold/hot air sneaking in and heated/cooled air
                    leaking
                    out. These areas can be spot-insulated with foam or caulking. Around outside-wall electric plugs,
                    a
                    cut-to-fit layer of foam can be easily installed inside the cover plate.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Check insulation. Check the attic floor, which should be filled with fluffy insulation (not
                    crumbling
                    or compacted). Also check basement ceiling, walls, water pipes, and furnace ducts. Snow melting
                    off
                    the
                    roof quicker than the neighbors` indicates poor attic insulation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Examine heating and cooling equipment. Change filters or invest in an electrostatic permanent and
                    efficient air filter. Keep equipment clean and in good working condition with annual professional
                    inspection. Keep vents open in rooms where the warm/cool air is needed, but closed in unused
                    areas.
                    Keep
                    vents vacuumed clean and unobstructed. Check ductwork for dirt streaks, which mark leaks and can
                    be
                    fixed with insulation or duct tape.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Be Energy Star savvy. Energy Star is a joint program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
                    (EPA)
                    and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) that encourages energy efficiency through strict
                    guidelines on
                    over 18,000 products in thirty-five categories, including whole home qualification.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Analyze the old and new. New homes, products, and appliances are far more efficient than older
                    ones,
                    so when replacing or improving, look for the Energy Star labels that indicate higher energy
                    efficiency.
                    New developments in water heaters, washers and dryers, dishwashers, and other major appliances
                    make
                    them
                    far more efficient than older and even recent models. Do your research and thorough product
                    comparison
                    before buying.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Try an electric usage monitor. Plug a “kill a watt” monitor into a plug, then into the electronic
                    device. It gives detailed energy use information and how much the unit costs to operate. Or
                    estimate
                    how
                    much energy an appliance uses with this formula: wattage multiplied by hours used per day divided
                    by
                    1,000 equals daily kWh usage; multiplied by the cost per kWh charged by the utility company, this
                    is a
                    daily amount to run the item. Wattage is stamped on the item. This may be motivation to upgrade to
                    a
                    more energy efficient model or find ways to save energy on the old appliance/device, such as
                    adjusting
                    temperature, cleaning, or repairing seals. Refrigerators at 37 degrees Fahrenheit and freezers at
                    3
                    degrees is about right.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Look for unnecessary usage. TVs, DVD players, and cell phone chargers, for example, left plugged
                    in
                    but not on, can be energy vampires, or phantom loads. They still draw power and add about 8
                    percent to
                    annual electric bills. Unplug unused devices, and turn off or use energy-smart, self-monitoring
                    power
                    strips.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Use less. Turning down the water heater from 140 to 120 degrees Fahrenheit reduces costs by 6 to
                    10
                    percent. Install low-flow water fixtures, such as toilets that use less than 1 gallon to flush. A
                    low-flow shower head can cut water used for bathing by 50 to 70 per-cent. Low-flow faucets are
                    available. Use fewer lights (sight safety first, however), and make them CFLs,
                    now available in a wider variety of colors and styles.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>Use a programmable thermostat. Resist the temptation to set air-conditioning too low and heating
                    too
                    high. For every degree you adjust in favor of energy savings, 1_3 percent is saved on the heating
                    bill.</p>
                </li>
