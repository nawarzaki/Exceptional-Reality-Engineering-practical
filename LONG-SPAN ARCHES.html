        <h2>LONG-SPAN ARCHES</h2>
      </header>

      <p>Arches are designed to support vertical loads primarily
        by axial compression. They use their curvilinear form to
        transform the vertical forces of a supported load into
        inclined components and transmit them to abutments on
        either side of the archway.</p>

      <h3>Fixed Arches</h3>

      <p>A fixed arch is designed as a continuous member, rigidly
        connected to both base supports. The arch must be
        designed to resist bending stresses throughout its length
        and at both of its supports. The shape of the fixed arch will
        generally exhibit a deeper section at the supports and a
        gradual decrease in the cross section at the crown. Fixed
        arches are generally constructed of reinforced, prestressed
        concrete or of steel sections.</p>

        </figcaption>
      </figure> <br><br>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>While circular arches are generally easier to construct,
            funicular arches are subject to a minimum of bending
            stresses.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>A funicular arch is one that is shaped to develop only
            axial compression under a given loading. This shape
            may be found by inverting the funicular shape for a
            cable carrying a similar loading pattern.</p>
        </li>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/LONG SPAN STRUCTURES/Fixed Arches 1.jpg" alt="LONG SPAN STRUCTURES"
            style="height: 24%; width: 45%;">

            <p><b>LONG-SPAN ARCHES</b></p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure> <br><br>


        <li>
          <p>There is no single funicular shape for an arch since it
            may be subject to many possible load conditions. If the
            loading pattern for which a funicular arch is designed
            changes, it would be subject to bending.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Thrust refers to any of the outward forces developed
            at the base of an arch due to the horizontal force
            components of applied loads. Arch thrust must be
            resisted by a tension tie or abutments.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The magnitude of the thrust produced is large for
            shallow (low rise-to-span ratio) arches and small for
            steep (high rise-to-span) arches.</p>
        </li>

      </ul>

      <h3>Rigid Arches</h3>

      <p>Contemporary arches consist of curved rigid structures of
        timber, steel, or reinforced concrete capable of carrying
        some bending stresses. Their structural behavior resembles
        that of rigid or moment-resisting frames.</p>
      <p>The geometry of
        the curves that replace the straight segments of the gabled
        rigid frame affects not only the cost of construction but
        also the resulting stresses in the frame members since no
        single funicular arch shape is possible for all possible load
        conditions.</p>

      <br><br>

      <h3>Two-Hinged Arches</h3>

      <p>Two-hinged arches are designed as a continuous structure
        with pin connections at both base supports. The pin joints
        prevent high bending stresses from developing by allowing
        the frame to rotate as a unit when strained by support
        settlements, and to flex slightly when stressed by changes
        in temperature. </p>

      <p>They are generally designed to be thicker
        at the crown to allow the load path to vary while limiting
        the magnitude of the bending stresses and retaining an
        arch-like form. Glue-laminated timber, fabricated steel
        sections, wood and steel trusses, and concrete have all
        been used in the construction of two-hinged arches.</p>

        <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/LONG SPAN STRUCTURES/Two_Hinged Arches 1.png"

        </figcaption>
      </figure> <br><br>

      <ul>

        <li>
          <p>Because the pinned connections develop no
            bending moments, they can usually be smaller in
            cross section and taper to the shoulder or haunch
            where the bending is largest and requires a larger
            section.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Vertical loads are transferred to the members of a
            rigid frame through a combination of compression
            and bending, but because the frame develops a
            degree of arch action, horizontal thrust results at
            each base support. Specially designed abutments
            or tension ties are required for thrust resistance.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The rigid arch is statically indeterminate and rigid only
            in its plane. A structural diaphragm or diagonal bracing
            is required to resist lateral forces in a perpendicular
            direction.</p>

      <h2>Three-Hinged Arches</h2>

      <p>Three-hinged arches are structural assemblies of two rigid
        sections connected to each other at the crown and to the
        base supports with pin joints. While more sensitive to
        deflection than either fixed or two-hinged frames, three-
        hinged arches are least affected by support settlements
        and thermal stresses.</p>

      <p>An advantage of three-hinged arches
        over two-hinged arches is their ease of fabrication as two
        or more rigid parts, which can then be transported to the
        construction site to be joined and erected.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/LONG SPAN STRUCTURES/Three_Hinged Arches.png"

      <ul>

        <li>
          <p>Glue-laminated timber arches are capable of spanning
            from 100 to 250 feet (30 to 76 m) with a depth to
            span ratio of about span/40. Transportation from the
            fabrication site to the construction site may be the
            limiting factor.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Steel arches are capable of spanning in excess of 500
            feet (152 m), especially if a trussed-arch system is used.
            Their depth range varies from span/50 to span/100.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Concrete arches can span up to 300 feet (91 m) and
            have a depth range of about span/50.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Long-span arches behave like rigid frames and may have either
            arched or gabled profiles.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Applied loads produce axial, bending, and shear forces in all
            members of a rigid frame because the use of moment-resisting
            joints restrain the ends of members from rotating freely. </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Vertical loads are transferred to the vertical members of a rigid
            frame through a combination of compression and bending, but
            because the frame develops a degree of arch action, horizontal
            thrust results at each base support. Specially designed
            abutments or tension ties are required for thrust resistance.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Purlins span between the three-hinged arches and
            support structural decking.</p>
        </li>

            <p><b>A parallel series of three-hinged arches is resistant to lateral
                forces in the plane of the frames but requires lateral-force-

        <p>Trussed arches and arched frames can often be a more
          economical alternative to monolithic rigid arches. They
          are more adaptable to fabrication in multiple sections for
          transportation to and joining at the construction site. Spans
          are generally under 150 feet (45.7 m) but can be made
          longer.</p>

                2004 (renovation of original 1991 structure), Santiago Calatrava</b></p>

            <p><b>The roof structure of the Olympic Velodrome is
                composed of two massive tubular arches, each
                weighing 4000 tons, from which 40 transverse ribs
                are suspended. There are 23 unique ribs, each used
                twice in the symmetrical structure. The last three
                ribs at each end are supported by the rim tube.
                The doubled cables from the upper arch not only
                carry part of the roof load but also help stabilize the
                structure laterally through its triangulated geometry.</b></p>
