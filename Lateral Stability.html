    <div>
      <p>When we consider a building's structural system, we typically
        think first of how its vertical supports and horizontal spanning
        assemblies are designed to carry the dead and live loads
        imposed by the weight of its construction and occupancy. </p>

      <p>Just
        as critical to the building's stability, however, is its resistance
        to a combination of environmental conditions, such as wind,
        earthquake, earth pressure, and temperature, which can
        destabilize its gravity load-carrying elements. </p>

      <p>Wind and earthquakes subject
        a structure to dynamic loading, often with rapid changes in
        magnitude and point of application. Under a dynamic load, a
        structure develops inertial forces in relation to its mass, and
        its maximum deformation does not necessarily correspond to
        the maximum magnitude of the applied force. Despite their
        dynamic nature, wind and earthquake loads are often treated
        as equivalent static loads acting in a lateral manner.</p>

      <br><br>

      <header>
        <h2>Wind</h2>
      </header>

      <p>Wind loads result from the forces exerted by the kinetic
        energy of a moving mass of air, which can produce a
        combination of direct pressure, negative pressure or suction,
        and drag forces on buildings and other obstacles in its path.
        Wind forces are typically assumed to be applied normal, or
        perpendicular, to the affected surfaces of a building.</p>

      <br><br>

      <header>
        <h2>Earthquakes</h2>
      </header>

      <p>Seismic forces result from the vibratory ground motions of
        an earthquake, which can cause a building's base to move
        suddenly and induce shaking of the structure in all directions
        simultaneously. While seismic ground motions are three-
        dimensional in nature and have horizontal, vertical, and
        rotational components, the horizontal component is considered
        to be the most important in structural design.</p>

      <p>During an
        earthquake, the mass of a building's structure develops
        an inertial force as it tries to resist the horizontal ground
        acceleration. The result is a shear force between the ground
        and the building's mass, which is distributed to each floor or
        diaphragm above the base.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="images/Francis D. K. Ching/Lateral Stability/Wind & Earthquakes.jpg" alt="Lateral Stability"
          style="height: 24%; width: 48%;">
        <figcaption>
          <p><b>Wind & Earthquakes</b></p>
        </figcaption>
      </figure><br><br>

      <p>All buildings are subject to lateral loading from wind and
        earthquakes. The structural systems of tall or slender
        buildings, however, tend to be dominated by the need
        to resist lateral forces, which can impose large bending
        moments on and cause lateral displacement of their
        vertical members.</p>

      <p>The structural design of buildings having a low aspect
        ratio, on the other hand, is predominantly governed by
        vertical gravity loads. Lateral loads due to wind and
        earthquakes have a relatively small effect on the sizing of
        members, but they cannot be ignored.</p>

      <p>Also, while both wind and earthquakes exert lateral loads
        on all buildings, they differ in how the lateral forces are
        applied. Perhaps the most significant of these differences
        is the inertial nature of seismic forces, which causes the
        applied forces to increase with the weight of a building.
        Weight is therefore a major liability in seismic design. In
        responding to wind forces, however, a building can use its
        weight to advantage to resist sliding and overturning.</p>

      <p>Likewise, a relatively stiff building subjected to wind forces
        responds favorably because its amplitude of vibration is
        small. However, a seismically loaded building tends to
        exhibit a better response if its structure is flexible, enabling
        it to dissipate some of the kinetic energy and moderate the
        resulting stresses through movement.</p>
